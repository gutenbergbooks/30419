<p><i>It will be generally allowed that a handy guide to the formation of
libraries is required, but it may be that the difficulty of doing justice
to so large a subject has prevented those who felt the want from
attempting to fill it. I hope therefore that it will not be considered
that I have shown temerity by stepping into the vacant place. I cannot
hope to have done full justice to so important a theme in the small space
at my disposal, but I think I can say that this little volume contains
much information which the librarian and the book lover require and cannot
easily obtain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> elsewhere. They are probably acquainted with most of this
information, but the memory will fail us at times and it is then
convenient to have a record at hand.</i></p>

<p><i>A book of this character is peculiarly open to criticism, but I hope the
critics will give me credit for knowing more than I have set down. In
making a list of books of reference, I have had to make a selection, and
works have been before me that I have decided to omit, although some would
think them as important as many of those I have included.</i></p>

<p><i>I need not extend this preface with any lengthy explanation of the
objects of the book, as these are stated in the Introduction, but before
concluding I may perhaps be allowed to allude to one personal
circumstance. I had hoped to dedicate this first volume of the Book
Lover's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> Library to <span class="smcap">Henry Bradshaw</span>, one of the most original and most
learned bibliographers that ever lived, but before it was finished the
spirit of that great man had passed away to the inexpressible grief of all
who knew him. It is with no desire to shield myself under the shelter of a
great name, but with a reverent wish to express my own sense of our
irreparable loss that I dedicate this book (though all unworthy of the
honour) to his memory.</i></p>

<h1>HOW TO FORM A LIBRARY.</h1>

</div>

<p>Although there can be little difference of opinion among book lovers as to
the need of a Handbook which shall answer satisfactorily the
question&mdash;"How to Form a Library"&mdash;it does not follow that there will be a
like agreement as to the best shape in which to put the answer. On the one
side a string of generalities can be of no use to any one, and on the
other a too great particularity of instruction may be resented by those
who only require hints on a few points, and feel that they know their own
business better than any author can tell them.</p>

<p>One of the most important attempts to direct the would-be founder of a
Library<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> in his way was made as long ago as 1824 by Dr. Dibdin, and the
result was entitled <i>The Library Companion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The book could never have
been a safe guide, and now it is hopelessly out of date. Tastes change,
and many books upon the necessity of possessing which Dibdin enlarges are
now little valued. Dr. Hill Burton writes of this book as follows in his
<i>Book-Hunter</i>: "This, it will be observed, is not intended as a manual of
rare or curious, or in any way peculiar books, but as the instruction of a
Nestor on the best books for study and use in all departments of
literature. Yet one will look in vain there for such names as Montaigne,
Shaftesbury, Benjamin Franklin, D'Alembert, Turgot, Adam Smith,
Malebranche, Lessing, Goethe, Schiller, F&eacute;n&eacute;lon, Burke, Kant, Richter,
Spinoza, Flechier, and many others. Characteristically enough, if you turn
up Rousseau in the index, you will find Jean Baptiste, but not Jean
Jacques. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> will search in vain for Dr. Thomas Reid the metaphysician,
but will readily find Isaac Reed the editor. If you look for Molin&aelig;us, or
Du Moulin, it is not there, but alphabetical vicinity gives you the good
fortune to become acquainted with "Moule, Mr., his <i>Bibliotheca
Heraldica</i>." The name of Hooker will be found, not to guide the reader to
the <i>Ecclesiastical Polity</i>, but to Dr. Jackson Hooker's <i>Tour in
Iceland</i>. Lastly, if any one shall search for Hartley <i>on Man</i>, he will
find in the place it might occupy, or has reference to, the editorial
services of 'Hazlewood, Mr. Joseph.'"</p>

<p>Although this criticism is to a great extent true, it does not do justice
to Dibdin's book, which contains much interesting and valuable matter, for
if the <i>Library Companion</i> is used not as a Guide to be followed, but as a
book for reference, it will be found of considerable use.</p>

<p>William Goodhugh's <i>English Gentleman's Library Manual, or a Guide to the
Formation of a Library of Select Literature</i>, was published in 1827. It
contains classified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> lists of library books, but these are not now of much
value, except for the notes which accompany the titles, and make this work
eminently readable. There are some literary anecdotes not to be found
elsewhere.</p>

<p>A most valuable work of reference is Mr. Edward Edwards's Report on the
formation of the Manchester Free Library, which was printed in 1851. It is
entitled, "<i>Librarian's First Report to the Books Sub-Committee on the
Formation of the Library, June 30, 1851, with Lists of Books suggested for
purchase</i>." The Lists are arranged in the following order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Works&mdash;collective and miscellaneous&mdash;of Standard British
authors; with a selection of those of the Standard authors
of America.</p>

<p>2. Works relative to the History, Topography, and Biography
of the United Kingdom, and of the United States of America.</p>

<p>3. Works relative to Political Economy, Finance, Trade,
Commerce, Agriculture, Mining, Manufactures, Inland
Communication, and Public Works.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Works relating to Physics, Mathematics, Mechanics,
Practical Engineering, Arts, and Trades, etc.</p>

<p>5. Voyages and Travels.</p>

<p>6. Works on Zoology, Botany, Mineralogy, and Geology.</p>

<p>7. Periodical Publications and Transactions of Learned
Societies (not included in Lists 2, 3, or 6), Collections,
Encyclop&aelig;dias, Gazetteers, Atlases, Dictionaries,
Bibliographies, Indexes, etc.</p></div>

<p>These draft lists include 4582 distinct works, extending to about 12,438
volumes, including pamphlets, but exclusive of 553 Parliamentary Papers
and Reports, or <i>Blue Books</i>. Such a practically useful collection of
lists of books will not easily be found elsewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. Edwards gives some rules for the formation of Libraries in the second
volume of his <i>Memoirs of Libraries</i> (p. 629), where he writes, "No task
is more likely to strip a man of self-conceit than that of having to
frame, and to carry out in detail a plan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> for the formation of a large
Library. When he has once got beyond those departments of knowledge in
which his own pursuits and tastes have specially interested him, the duty
becomes a difficult one, and the certainty, that with his best efforts, it
will be very imperfectly performed is embarrassing and painful. If, on the
other hand, the task be imposed upon a 'Committee,' there ensues almost
the certainty that its execution will depend at least as much on chance as
on plan: that responsibility will be so attenuated as to pass off in
vapour; and that the collection so brought together will consist of parts
bearing but a chaotic sort of relation to the whole."</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Stevens printed in 1853 his pretty little book entitled
<i>Catalogue of my English Library</i>, which contains a very useful selection
of Standard books. In his Introduction the author writes, "It was my
intention in the outset not to exceed 4000 volumes, but little by little
the list has increased to 5751 volumes. I have been considerably puzzled
to know what titles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> to strike out in my next impression, being well aware
that what is trash to one person is by no means such to another; also that
many books of more merit than those admitted have been omitted. You may
not think it difficult to strike out twenty authors, and to add twenty
better ones in their place, but let me relate to you a parable. I
requested twenty men, whose opinions on the Literary Exchange are as good
as those of the Barings or the Rothschilds on the Royal, each to expunge
twenty authors and to insert twenty others of better standing in their
places, promising to exclude in my next impression any author who should
receive more than five votes. The result was, as may be supposed, not a
single expulsion or addition."</p>

<p>In 1855 Mons. Hector Bossange produced a companion volume, entitled <i>Ma
Biblioth&egrave;que Fran&ccedil;aise</i>. It contains a select list of about 7000 volumes,
and is completed with Indexes of Subjects, Authors, and Persons.</p>

<p>For helpful Bibliographical Guides we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> often have to look to the United
States, and we do not look in vain. A most useful Handbook, entitled <i>The
Best Reading</i>, was published in 1872 by George P. Putman, and the work
edited by F.B. Perkins is now in its fourth edition.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The books are
arranged in an alphabet of subjects, and the titles are short, usually
being well within a single line. A very useful system of appraisement of
the value of the books is adopted. Thus: <i>a</i>, means that the book so
marked is considered <i>the</i> book, or as good as any, <i>at a moderate cost</i>;
<i>b</i> means, in like manner, the best of the more elaborate or costly books
on the subject. In the department of <span class="smcap">Fiction</span>, a more precise
classification has been attempted, in which a general idea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> of the
relative importance of the <i>authors</i> is indicated by the use of the
letters <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, and of the relative value of their several
works by the asterisks * and **."</p>

<p>Having noted a few of the Guides which are now at hand for the use of the
founders of a library, we may be allowed to go back somewhat in time, and
consider how our predecessors treated this same subject, and we can then
conclude the present Introduction with a consideration of the less
ambitious attempts to instruct the book collector which may be found in
papers and articles.</p>

<p>One of the earliest works on the formation of a library was written by
Bishop Cardona, and published at Tarragona in 1587, in a thin volume
entitled <i>De regia S. Laurentii Bibliothec&acirc;. De Pontificia Vaticana</i>
[etc.].</p>

<p>Justus Lipsius wrote his <i>De Bibliothecis Syntagma</i> at the end of the
sixteenth century, and next in importance we come to Gabriel Naud&eacute;, who
published one of the most famous of bibliographical essays.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> The first
edition was published at Paris in 1627, and the second edition in 1644.
This was reprinted in Paris by J. Liseux in 1876&mdash;"<i>Advis pour dresser une
Biblioth&egrave;que, pr&eacute;sent&eacute; &agrave; Monseigneur le Pr&eacute;sident de Mesme</i>, par G. Naud&eacute;
P. Paris, chez Fran&ccedil;ois Farga, 1627."</p>

<p>This essay was translated by John Evelyn, and dedicated to Lord Chancellor
Clarendon. "<i>Instructions concerning erecting of a Library</i>; Presented to
My Lord the President De Mesme. By Gabriel Naudeus P., and now interpreted
by Jo. Evelyn, Esquire, London, 1661."</p>

<p>Naud&eacute; enlarges on the value of Catalogues, and recommends the book-buyer
to make known his desires, so that others may help him in the search, or
supply his wants. He specially mentions two modes of forming a library;
one is to buy libraries entire, and the other is to hunt at book-stalls.
He advised the book-buyer not to spend too much upon bindings.</p>

<p>Naud&eacute; appears to have been a born librarian, for at the early age of
twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> the President De Mesme appointed him to take charge of his
library. He left his employer in 1626, in order to finish his medical
studies. Cardinal Bagni took him to Rome, and when Bagni died, Naud&eacute;
became librarian to Cardinal Barberini. Richelieu recalled him to Paris in
1642, to act as his librarian, but the Minister dying soon afterwards,
Naud&eacute; took the same office under Mazarin. During the troubles of the
Fronde, the librarian had the mortification of seeing the library which he
had collected dispersed; and in consequence he accepted the offer of Queen
Christina, to become her librarian at Stockholm. Naud&eacute; was not happy
abroad, and when Mazarin appealed to him to reform his scattered library,
he returned at once, but died on the journey home at Abbeville, July 29,
1653.</p>

<p>The Mazarin Library consisted of more than 40,000 volumes, arranged in
seven rooms filled from top to bottom. It was rich in all classes, but
more particularly in Law and Physic. Naud&eacute; described it with enthusiasm as
"the most beautiful and best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> furnished of any library now in the world,
or that is likely (if affection does not much deceive me) ever to be
hereafter." Such should be a library in the formation of which the Kings
and Princes and Ambassadors of Europe were all helpers. Naud&eacute; in another
place called it "the work of my hands and the miracle of my life." Great
therefore was his dejection when the library was dispersed. Of this he
said, "Beleeve, if you please, that the ruine of this Library will be more
carefully marked in all Histories and Calendars, than the taking and
sacking of Constantinople." Naud&eacute;'s letter on the destruction of the
Mazarin Library was published in London in 1652, and the pamphlet was
reprinted in the <i>Harleian Miscellany</i>. "<i>News from France, or a
Description of the Library of Cardinall Mazarini, before it was utterly
ruined.</i> Sent in a letter from G. Naud&aelig;us, Keeper of the Publick Library.
London, Printed for Timothy Garthwait, 1652." 4to. 4 leaves.</p>

<p>In 1650 was published at London, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> Samuel Hartlib, a little book
entitled, "<i>The Reformed Librarie Keeper, with a Supplement to the
Reformed School, as Subordinate to Colleges in Universities</i>. By John
Durie. London, William Du-Gard, 1650."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>John Durie's ideas on the educational value of Libraries and the high
function of the Librarian are similar to those enunciated by Carlyle, when
he wrote, "The true University of these days is a Collection of Books." Of
this point, as elaborated in the proposal to establish Professorships of
Bibliography, we shall have something more to say further on.</p>

<p>It is always interesting to see the views of great men exemplified in the
selection of books for a Library, and we may with advantage study the
lists prepared by George III. and Dr. Johnson. The King was a collector of
the first rank, as is evidenced by his fine library, now in the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Museum, and he knew his books well. When he was about to visit Weymouth,
he wrote to his bookseller for the following books to be supplied to him
to form a closet library at that watering place. The list was written from
memory, and it was printed by Dibdin in his <i>Library Companion</i>, from the
original document in the King's own handwriting:</p>

<p>It is curious to notice in both these lists how many of the books are now
quite superseded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>In another place Boswell tells us what were Johnson's views on book
collecting. "When I mentioned that I had seen in the King's Library
sixty-three editions of my favourite <i>Thomas &agrave; Kempis</i>, amongst which it
was in eight languages, Latin, German, French, Italian, Spanish, English,
Arabick, and Armenian, he said he thought it unnecessary to collect many
editions of a book, which were all the same, except as to the paper and
print; he would have the original, and all the translations, and all the
editions which had any variations in the text. He approved of the famous
collection of editions of Horace by Douglas, mentioned by Pope, who is
said to have had a closet filled with them; and he said every man should
try to collect one book in that manner, and present it to a Publick
Library."</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson's notion as to the collection of editions which are alike
except in the point of paper is scarcely sound, but it has been held by a
librarian of the present day, as I know to my cost. On one occasion I was
anxious to see several copies of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> first folio of Shakespeare (1623),
and I visited a certain library which possessed more than one. The
librarian expressed the opinion that one was quite sufficient for me to
see, as "they were all alike."</p>

<p>The possessor of a Private Library can act as a <i>censor morum</i> and keep
out of his collection any books which offend against good morals, but this
<i>role</i> is one which is unfit for the librarian of a Public Library. He may
put difficulties in the way of the ordinary reader seeing such books, but
nevertheless they should be in his library for the use of the student. A
most amusing instance of misapplied zeal occurred at the Advocates'
Library on the 27th June, 1754. The Minutes tell the tale in a way that
speaks for itself and requires no comment. "Mr. James Burnet [afterwards
Lord Monboddo], and Sir David Dalrymple [afterwards Lord Hailes], Curators
of the Library, having gone through some accounts of books lately bought,
and finding therein the three following French books: <i>Les Contes de La
Fontaine</i>, <i>L'Histoire Amoureuse des Gaules</i> and <i>L'Ecumoire</i>, they
ordain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> that the said books be struck out of the Catalogue of the Library,
and removed from the shelves, as indecent books, unworthy of a place in a
learned Library."</p>

<p>At a Conference of Representatives of Institutions in Union with the
Society of Arts held in July, 1855, the question of the compilation of a
Catalogue of Books fitted for the Libraries of Institutions was raised,
and shortly afterwards was published, under the sanction of the Council,
"<i>A Handbook of Mechanics' Institutions, with Priced Catalogue of Books
suitable for Libraries, and Periodicals for Reading Rooms</i>, by W.H.J.
Traice." A second edition of this book was published in 1863. The list,
however, is not now of much use, as many of the books have been
superseded. Theology and Politics are not included in the classification.</p>

<p>In 1868 Mr. Mullins read a paper before a Meeting of the Social Science
Association at Birmingham, on the management of Free Libraries, and, in
its reprinted form, this has become a Handbook on the subject: "<i>Free
Libraries and News-rooms, their Formation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> and Management</i>. By J.D.
Mullins, Chief Librarian, Birmingham Free Libraries. Third edition.
London, Sotheran and Co., 1879." An appendix contains copies of the Free
Libraries Acts and Amendments, and a "Short List of Books for a Free
Lending Library, ranging in price from 1<i>s.</i> to 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per volume."</p>

<p>Mr. Axon read a paper on the Formation of Small Libraries intended for the
Co-Operative Congress in 1869, which was reprinted as a pamphlet of eight
pages: "<i>Hints on the Formation of Small Libraries intended for Public
Use.</i> By Wm. E.A. Axon. London, N. Tr&uuml;bner and Co."</p>

<p>Mr. A.R. Spofford has given a valuable list of books and articles in
periodicals, on the subject of Libraries in chapter 36 (Library
Bibliography), of the <i>Report on Public Libraries in the U.S.</i> (1876).</p>

<p>The volume of <i>Transactions and Proceedings of the Conference of
Librarians</i>, London, 1877, contains two papers on the Selection of Books,
one by Mr. Robert Harrison, Librarian of the London Library, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
other by the late Mr. James M. Anderson, Assistant Librarian of the
University of St. Andrews. Mr. Harrison gives the following as the three
guiding principles of selection in forming a library: 1. Policy; 2.
Utility; 3. Special or Local Appropriateness; and he deals with each
successively. Mr. Anderson writes that "the selection of books should
invariably be made (1) in relation to the library itself, and (2) in
relation to those using it."</p>

<p>We have chiefly to do with the formation of libraries, and therefore the
use made of them when they are formed cannot well be enlarged upon here,
but a passing note may be made on the proposal which has been much
discussed of late years, viz. that for Professorships of Books and
Reading. The United States Report on Public Libraries contains a chapter
on this subject by F.B. Perkins and William Matthews (pp. 230-251), and
Mr. Axon also contributed a paper at the First Annual Meeting of the
Library Association. The value of such chairs, if well filled, is
self-evident,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> for it takes a man a long time (without teaching) to learn
how best to use books, but very special men would be required as
Professors. America has done much to show what the duties of such a
Professor should be, and Harvard College is specially fortunate in
possessing an officer in Mr. Justin Winsor who is both a model librarian
and a practical teacher of the art of how best to use the books under his
charge.</p>

</div>

<p>As long as books have existed there have been book collectors. It is easy
now to collect, for books of interest are to be found on all sides; but in
old times this was not so, and we must therefore admire the more those men
who formed their libraries under the greatest difficulties. In a book
devoted to the formation of libraries it seems but fair to devote some
space to doing honour to those who have formed libraries, and perhaps some
practical lessons may be learned from a few historical facts.</p>

<p>Englishmen may well be proud of Richard Aungerville de Bury, a man
occupying a busy and exalted station, who not only collected books with
ardour united with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> judgment, but has left for the benefit of later ages a
manual which specially endears his memory to all book lovers.</p>

<p>He collected books, and often took them in place of corn for tithes and
dues, but he also produced books, for he kept copyists in his house. Many
of these books were carefully preserved in his palace at Durham, but it is
also pleasant to think of some of them being carefully preserved in the
noble mansion belonging to his see which stood by the side of the Thames,
and on the site of the present Adelphi.</p>

<p>Petrarch was a book-loving poet, and he is said to have met the
book-loving ecclesiastic Richard de Bury at Rome. He gave his library to
the Church of St. Mark at Venice in 1362; but the guardians allowed the
books to decay, and few were rescued. Boccaccio bequeathed his library to
the Augustinians at Florence, but one cannot imagine the books of the
accomplished author of the <i>Decameron</i> as very well suited for the needs
of a religious society, and it was probably weeded before Boccaccio's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
death. The remains of the library are still shown to visitors in the
Laurentian Library, the famous building due to the genius of Michael
Angelo.</p>

<p>Cardinal John Bessarion gave his fine collection (which included about 600
Greek MSS.) to St. Mark's in 1468, and in the letter to the Doge which
accompanied his gift, he tells some interesting particulars of his early
life as a collector. He writes, "From my youth I have bestowed my pains
and exertion in the collection of books on various sciences. In former
days I copied many with my own hands, and I have employed on the purchase
of others such small means as a frugal and thrifty life permitted me to
devote to the purpose."</p>

<p>The Rev. Joseph Hunter printed in 1831 a valuable Catalogue of the Library
of the Priory of Bretton in Yorkshire, and added to it some notices of the
Libraries belonging to other Religious Houses, in which he gives us a good
idea of the contents of these libraries. He writes, "On comparing the
Bretton Catalogue with that of other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> religious communities, we find the
libraries of the English monasteries composed of very similar materials.
They consisted of&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. The Scriptures; and these always in an English or the
Latin version. A Greek or Hebrew Manuscript of the
Scriptures is not found in Leland's notes, or, I believe, in
any of the catalogues. In Wetstein's Catalogue of MSS. of
the New Testament, only one (Codex 59) is traced into the
hands of an English community of religious.</p>

<p>2. The Commentators.</p>

<p>3. The Fathers.</p>

<p>4. Services and Rituals of the Church.</p>

<p>5. Writers in the Theological Controversies of the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p>6. Moral and Devotional Writings.</p>

<p>7. Canon Law.</p>

<p>8. The Schoolmen.</p>

<p>9. Grammatical Writers.</p>

<p>10. Writers in Mathematics and Physics.</p>

<p>11. Medical Writers.</p>

<p>12. Collections of Epistles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>13. The Middle Age Poets and Romance-Writers.</p>

<p>14. The Latin Classics.</p>

<p>15. The Chronicles.</p>

<p>16. The Historical Writings of doubtful authority, commonly
called Legends.</p></div>

<p>Most of the manuscripts which composed the monastic libraries were
destroyed at the Reformation."</p>

<p>Humphry Plantagenet Duke of Gloucester, whose fame has been so lasting as
the 'good Duke Humphry,' was also a book-collector of renown; but most of
the old libraries we read about have left but little record of their
existence: thus the Common Library at Guildhall, founded by Dick
Whittington in 1420, and added to by John Carpenter, the Town Clerk of
London, has been entirely destroyed, the books having, in the first
instance, been carried away by Edward Seymour Duke of Somerset.</p>

<p>Although, as we have seen from Mr. Hunter's remarks, there was a
considerable amount of variety in the subjects of these manuscript
collections, we must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> still bear in mind that in a large number of
instances the contents of the libraries consisted of little more than
Breviaries and Service Books. It has been pointed out that this fact is
illustrated by the union of the offices of Precentor and Armarius in one
person, who had charge of the Library (Armarium) and its great feeder, the
Writing-room (Scriptorium), as well as the duty of leading the singing in
the church. Many lists of old libraries have been preserved, and these
have been printed in various bibliographical works, thus giving us a
valuable insight into the reading of our forefathers.</p>

<p>When we come to consider libraries of printed books in place of
manuscripts, we naturally find a greater variety of subjects collected by
the famous men who have formed collections. Montaigne, the friend of all
literary men, could not have been the man we know him to have been if he
had not lived among his books. Like many a later book-lover, he decorated
his library with mottoes, and burnt-in his inscriptions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> letter by letter
with his own hands. Grotius made his love of books do him a special
service, for he escaped from prison in a box which went backwards and
forwards with an exchange of books for his entertainment and instruction.</p>

<p>Grolier and De Thou stand so pre-eminent among book collectors, and from
the beauty of the copies they possessed the relics of their libraries are
so frequently seen, that it seems merely necessary here to mention their
names. But as Frenchmen may well boast of these men, so Englishmen can
take pride in the possession of the living memory of Archbishop Parker,
who enriched Cambridge, and of Sir Thomas Bodley, who made the Library at
Oxford one of the chief glories of our land.</p>

<p>Old Lists of Books are always of interest to us as telling what our
forefathers cared to have about them, but it is seldom that a list is so
tantalising as one described by Mr. Edward Edwards in his <i>Libraries and
Founders of Libraries</i>. Anne of Denmark presented her son Charles with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
splendid series of volumes, bound in crimson and purple velvet. Abraham
van der Dort, who was keeper of Charles's cabinet, made an inventory of
this cabinet; and having no notion of how to make a catalogue of books, he
has managed to leave out all the information we wish for. The inventory is
among the Harleian MSS. (4718), and the following are specimens of the
entries:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Im'pris 19 books in Crimson velvet, whereof 18 are bound
4to. and y<sup>e</sup> 19th in folio, adorn'd with some silver guilt
plate, and y<sup>e</sup> 2 claspes wanting. Given to y<sup>e</sup> King by Queen
Ann of famous memory.</p>

<p>Item, more 15 books, 13 thereof being in long 4to. and y<sup>e</sup> 2
lesser cover'd over also with purple velvet. Given also to
y<sup>e</sup> King by y<sup>e</sup> said Queen Ann."</p></div>

<p>Most of the famous private libraries of days gone by have left little
record of their existence, but Evelyn's collection is still carefully
preserved at Wotton, the house of the Diarist's later years, and Pepys's
books<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> continue at Cambridge in the cases he had made for them, and in the
order he fixed for them. In a long letter to Pepys, dated from Sayes
Court, 12th August, 1689, Evelyn gives an account of such private
libraries as he knew of in England, and in London more particularly. He
first mentions Lord Chancellor Clarendon, to whom he dedicated his
translation of Naud&eacute;'s Advice, and who "furnished a very ample library."
Evelyn observes that England was peculiarly defective in good libraries:
"Paris alone, I am persuaded, being able to show more than all the three
nations of Great Britain." He describes Dr. Stillingfleet's, at
Twickenham, as the very best library.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He did not think much either of
the Earl of Bristol's or of Sir Kenelm Digby's books, but he says Lord
Maitland's "was certainly the noblest, most substantial and accomplished
library that ever passed under the spear."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>In a useful little volume published at London in 1739, and entitled, <i>A
Critical and Historical Account of all the Celebrated Libraries in Foreign
Countries, as well ancient as modern</i>, which is stated to be written by "a
Gentleman of the Temple," are some "General Reflections upon the Choice of
Books and the Method of furnishing Libraries and Cabinets." As these
reflections are interesting in themselves, and curious as the views of a
writer of the middle of the eighteenth century on this important subject,
I will transfer them bodily to these pages.</p>

<p>"Nothing can be more laudable than forming Libraries, when the founders
have no other view than to improve themselves and men of letters: but it
will be necessary, in the first place, to give some directions, which will
be of great importance towards effecting the design, as well with regard
to the choice of books as the manner of placing to advantage: nor is it
sufficient in this case, to be learned, since he who would have a
collection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> worthy of the name of a library must of all things have a
thorough knowledge of books, that he may distinguish such as are valuable
from the trifling. He must likewise understand the price of Books,
otherwise he may purchase some at too high a rate, and undervalue others:
all which requires no small judgment and experience.</p>

<p>"Let us suppose, then, the founder possessed of all those qualifications,
three things fall next under consideration.</p>

<p>"First, the number of books; secondly, their quality; and, lastly, the
order in which they ought to be ranged.</p>

<p>"As to the quantity, regard must be had, as well to places as to persons;
for should a man of moderate fortune propose to have a Library for his own
use only, it would be imprudent in him to embarrass his affairs in order
to effect it. Under such circumstances he must rather consider the
usefulness than the number of books, for which we have the authority of
Seneca, who tells us that a multitude of books is more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> burthensome than
instructive to the understanding.</p>

<p>"But if a private person has riches enough for founding a Library, as well
for his own use as for the public, he ought to furnish it with the most
useful volumes in all arts and sciences, and procure such as are scarcest
and most valuable, from all parts, that the learned, of whom there are
many classes, may instruct themselves in what may be useful to them, and
may gratify their enquiries. But as the condition and abilities of such as
would form Libraries are to be distinguished, so regard must likewise be
had to places, for it is very difficult to procure, or collect books in
some countries, without incredible expense; a design of that kind would be
impracticable in America, Africa, and some parts of Asia; so that nothing
can be determined as to the number of books, that depending entirely upon
a variety of circumstances, and the means of procuring them, as has been
observ'd before.</p>

<p>"As to the second topic, special care must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> be taken in the choice of
books, for upon that alone depends the value of a Library. We must not
form a judgment of books either by their bulk or numbers, but by their
intrinsic merit and usefulness. Alexander Severus's Library consisted of
no more than four volumes, that is the works of Plato, Cicero, Virgil, and
Horace. Melanchthon seems to have imitated that Prince, for his collection
amounted to four books only, Plato, Pliny, Plutarch, and Ptolemy.</p>

<p>"There is another necessary lesson for those who form designs of making
libraries, that is, that they must disengage themselves from all
prejudices with regard either to ancient or modern books, for such a wrong
step often precipitates the judgment, without scrutiny or examination, as
if truth and knowledge were confined to any particular times or places.
The ancients and moderns should be placed in collections, indifferently,
provided they have those characters we hinted before.</p>

<p>"Let us now proceed to the third head, the manner of placing books in such
order,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> as that they may be resorted to upon any emergency, without
difficulty, otherwise they can produce but little advantage either to the
owners or others.</p>

<p>"The natural method of placing books and manuscripts is to range them in
separate classes or apartments, according to the science, art, or subject,
of which they treat.</p>

<p>"Here it will be necessary to observe, that as several authors have
treated of various subjects, it may be difficult to place them under any
particular class; Plutarch, for instance, who was an historian, a
political writer, and a philosopher. The most advisable method then is to
range them under the head of Miscellaneous Authors, with proper references
to each subject, but this will be more intelligible by an example.</p>

<p>"Suppose, then, we would know the names of the celebrated Historians of
the ancients; nothing more is necessary than to inspect the class under
which the historians are placed, and so of other Faculties. By this
management, one set of miscellaneous authors will be sufficient, and may
be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> resorted to with as much ease and expedition as those who have
confined themselves to one subject. In choice of books regard must be had
to the edition, character, paper and binding. As to the price, it is
difficult to give any positive directions; that of ordinary works is
easily known, but as to such as are very scarce and curious, we can only
observe that their price is as uncertain as that of medals and other
monuments of antiquity, and often depends more on the caprice of the buyer
than the intrinsic merit of the work, some piquing themselves upon the
possession of things from no other consideration than their exorbitant
price."</p>

<p>Dr. Byrom's quaint library is still preserved at Manchester in its
entirety. Bishop Moore's fine collection finds a resting place in the
University Library at Cambridge, and the relics of the Library of Harley,
Earl of Oxford, a mine of manuscript treasure, still remain one of the
chief glories of the British Museum. How much cause for regret is there
that the library itself, which Osborne bought and Johnson described, did
not also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> find a settled home, instead of being dispersed over the land.</p>

<p>It is greatly to the credit of the rich and busy man to spend his time and
riches in the collection of a fine library, but still greater honour is
due to the poor man who does not allow himself to be pulled down by his
sordid surroundings. The once-famous small-coalman, Thomas Britton,
furnishes a most remarkable instance of true greatness in a humble
station, and one, moreover, which was fully recognized in his own day. He
lived next door to St. John's Gate, Clerkenwell, and although he gained
his living by selling coals from door to door, many persons of the highest
station were in the habit of attending the musical meetings held at his
house. He was an excellent chemist as well as a good musician, and Thomas
Hearne tells us that he left behind him "a valuable collection of musick
mostly pricked by himself, which was sold upon his death for near an
hundred pounds," "a considerable collection of musical instruments which
was sold for fourscore pounds,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> "not to mention the excellent collection
of printed books that he also left behind him, both of chemistry and
musick. Besides these books that he left, he had some years before his
death (1714) sold by auction a noble collection of books, most of them in
the Rosicrucian faculty (of which he was a great admirer), whereof there
is a printed catalogue extant, as there is of those that were sold after
his death, which catalogue I have by me (by the gift of my very good
friend Mr. Bagford), and have often looked over with no small surprize and
wonder, and particularly for the great number of MSS. in the
before-mentioned faculties that are specified in it."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, although a great reader, was not a collector of books. He was
forced to possess many volumes while he was compiling his Dictionary, but
when that great labour was completed, he no longer felt the want of them.
Goldsmith, on the other hand, died possessed of a considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> number of
books which he required, or had at some time required, for his studies.
"The Select Collection of Scarce, Curious, and Valuable Books, in English,
Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and other Languages, late the Library of
Dr. Goldsmith, deceased," was sold on Tuesday, the 12th of July, 1774, and
the Catalogue will be found in the Appendix to Forster's Life. There were
30 lots in folio, 26 in quarto, and 106 in octavo and smaller sizes. Among
the books of interest in this list are Chaucer's Works, 1602; Davenant's
Works, 1673; Camoens, by Fanshawe, 1655; Cowley's Works, 1674; Shelton's
Don Quixote; Raleigh's History of the World, 1614; Bulwer's Artificial
Changeling, 1653; Verstegan's Antiquities, 1634; Hartlib's Legacie, 1651;
Sir K. Digby on the Nature of Bodies, 1645; Warton's History of English
Poetry, 1774; Encyclop&eacute;die, 25 vols., 1770; Fielding's Works, 12 vols.,
1766; Bysshe's Art of Poetry; Hawkins's Origin of the English Drama, 3
vols., 1773; Percy's Reliques, 3 vols., Dublin, 1766;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> Sir William
Temple's Works; and De Bure, Bibliographie Instructive.</p>

<p>A catalogue such as this, made within a few weeks of the death of the
owner, cannot but have great interest for us. The library could not have
been a very choice one, for there is little notice of bindings and much
mention of odd volumes. It was evidently a working collection, containing
the works of the poets Goldsmith loved, and of the naturalists from whom
he stole his knowledge.</p>

<p>Gibbon was a true collector, who loved his books, and he must have needed
them greatly, working as he did at Lausanne away from public libraries.
After his death the library was purchased by 'Vathek' Beckford, but he
kept it buried, and it was of no use to any one. Eventually it was sold by
auction, a portion being bought for the Canton, and another portion going
to America. There was little in the man Gibbon to be enthusiastic about,
but it is impossible for any true book lover not to delight in the
thoroughness of the author<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> of one of the noblest books ever written. The
fine old house where the <i>Decline and Fall</i> was written and the noble
library was stored still stands, and the traveller may stroll in the
garden so beautifully described by Gibbon when he walked to the historical
<i>berceau</i> and felt that his herculean labour was completed. His heart must
be preternaturally dull which does not beat quicker as he walks on that
ground. The thought of a visit some years ago forms one of the most vivid
of the author's pleasures of memory.</p>

<p>Charles Burney, the Greek scholar, is said to have expended nearly &pound;25,000
on his library, which consisted of more than 13,000 printed volumes and a
fine collection of MSS. The library was purchased for the British Museum
for the sum of &pound;13,500.</p>

<p>Charles Burney probably inherited his love of collecting from his father,
for Dr. Burney possessed some twenty thousand volumes. These were rather
an incumbrance to the Doctor, and when he moved to Chelsea Hospital, he
was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> some difficulty respecting them. Mrs. Chapone, when she heard of
these troubles, proved herself no bibliophile, for she exclaimed, "Twenty
thousand volumes! bless me! why, how can he so encumber himself? Why does
he not burn half? for how much must be to spare that never can be worth
his looking at from such a store! and can he want to keep them all?"</p>

<p>The love of books will often form a tie of connection between very
divergent characters, and in dealing with men who have formed libraries we
can bring together the names of those who had but little sympathy with
each other during life.</p>

<p>George III. was a true book collector, and the magnificent library now
preserved in the British Museum owes its origin to his own judgment and
enthusiastic love for the pursuit. Louis XVI. cared but little for books
until his troubles came thick upon him, and then he sought solace from
their pages. During that life in the Temple we all know so well from the
sad reading of its incidents, books were not denied to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> the persecuted
royal family. There was a small library in the "little tower," and the
king drew up a list of books to be supplied to him from the library at the
Tuileries. The list included the works of Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and
Terence; of Tacitus, Livy, C&aelig;sar, Marcus Aurelius, Eutropius, Cornelius
Nepos, Florus, Justin, Quintus Curtius, Sallust, Suetonius and Velleius
Paterculus; the <i>Vies des Saints</i>, the <i>Fables de la Fontaine</i>,
<i>T&eacute;l&egrave;maque</i>, and Rollin's <i>Trait&eacute; des Etudes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The more we know of Napoleon, and anecdotes of him are continually being
published in the ever-lengthening series of French memoirs, the less
heroic appears his figure, but he could not have been entirely bad, for he
truly loved books. He began life as an author, and would always have books
about him. He complained if the printing was bad or the binding poor, and
said, "I will have fine editions and handsome binding. I am rich enough
for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> that."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Thus spoke the true bibliophile. Mr. Edwards has collected
much interesting information respecting Napoleon and his libraries, and of
his labours I here freely avail myself. Bourrienne affirms that the
authors who chiefly attracted Napoleon in his school days were Polybius,
Plutarch, and Arrian. "Shortly before he left France for Egypt, Napoleon
drew up, with his own hand, the scheme of a travelling library, the charge
of collecting which was given to John Baptist Say, the Economist. It
comprised about three hundred and twenty volumes, more than half of which
are historical, and nearly all, as it seems, in French. The ancient
historians comprised in the list are Thucydides, Plutarch, Polybius,
Arrian, Tacitus, Livy, and Justin. The poets are Homer, Virgil, Tasso,
Ariosto, the <i>T&eacute;l&egrave;maque</i> of F&eacute;n&eacute;lon, the <i>Henriade</i> of Voltaire, with
Ossian and La Fontaine. Among the works of prose fiction are the English
novelists in forty volumes, of course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> in translations, and the
indispensable <i>Sorrows of Werter</i>, which, as he himself told Goethe,
Napoleon had read through seven times prior to October, 1808. In this list
the Bible, together with the <i>Koran</i> and the <i>Vedas</i>, are whimsically, but
significantly, entered under the heading Politics and Ethics (Politique et
Morale).<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Napoleon was not, however, satisfied with the camp libraries which were
provided for him; the good editions were too bulky and the small editions
too mean: so he arranged the plan of a library to be expressly printed for
him in a thousand duodecimo volumes without margins, bound in thin covers
and with loose backs. "In this new plan 'Religion' took its place as the
first class. The Bible was to be there in its best translation, with a
selection of the most important works of the Fathers of the Church, and a
series of the best dissertations on those leading religious sects&mdash;their
doctrines and their history&mdash;which have powerfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> influenced the world.
This section was limited to forty volumes. The Koran was to be included,
together with a good book or two on mythology. One hundred and forty
volumes were allotted to poetry. The epics were to embrace Homer, Lucan,
Tasso, <i>Telemachus</i>, and the <i>Henriade</i>. In the dramatic portion Corneille
and Racine were of course to be included, but of Corneille, said Napoleon,
you shall print for me 'only what is vital' (ce qui est rest&eacute;), and from
Racine you shall omit '<i>Les Fr&egrave;res ennemis</i>, the <i>Alexandre</i>, and <i>Les
Plaideurs</i>. Of Cr&eacute;billon, he would have only <i>Rhadamiste</i> and <i>Atr&eacute;e et
Thyeste</i>. Voltaire was to be subject to the same limitation as
Corneille.'"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In prose fiction Napoleon specifies the <i>Nouvelle H&eacute;loise</i>
and Rousseau's <i>Confessions</i>, the masterpieces of Fielding, Richardson and
Le Sage, and Voltaire's tales. Soon after this Napoleon proposed a much
larger scheme for a camp library, in which history alone would occupy
three thousand volumes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> History was to be divided into these sections&mdash;I.
Chronology and Universal History. II. Ancient History (<i>a.</i> by ancient
writers, <i>b.</i> by modern writers). III. History of the Lower Empire (in
like subdivisions). IV. History, both general and particular. V. The
Modern History of the different States of Europe. The celebrated
bibliographer Barbier drew up, according to the Emperor's orders, a
detailed catalogue of the works which should form such a library. "He
calculated that by employing a hundred and twenty compositors and
twenty-five editors, the three thousand volumes could be produced, in
satisfactory shape, and within six years, at a total cost of &pound;163,200,
supposing fifty copies of each book to be printed."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The printing was
begun, but little was actually done, and in six years Napoleon was in St.
Helena.</p>

<p>In his last island home Napoleon had a library, and he read largely, often
aloud, with good effect. It is an interesting fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> that among Napoleon's
papers were found some notes on Geography written when a boy, and these
close with the words&mdash;"<i>Sainte-H&eacute;l&egrave;ne&mdash;petite ile</i>."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>In recapitulating here the names of a few of the famous men who have
formed libraries it will be necessary to divide them into two classes, 1,
those whose fame arises from their habit of collecting, and 2, those
authors in whose lives we are so much interested that the names of the
books they possessed are welcomed by us as indications of their
characters. What can be said of the libraries of the Duke of Roxburghe,
Earl Spencer, Thomas Grenville, and Richard Heber that has not been said
often before? Two of these have been dispersed over the world, and two
remain, one the glory of a noble family, and the other of the nation, or
perhaps it would be more proper to say both are the glory of the nation,
for every Englishman must be proud that the Spencer Library still remains
intact.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Heber left behind him over 100,000 volumes, in eight houses, four in
England and four on the Continent, and no record remains of this immense
library but the volumes of the sale catalogues. Such wholesale collection
appears to be allied to madness, but Heber was no selfish collector, and
his practice was as liberal as Grolier's motto. His name is enshrined in
lasting verse by Scott:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy volumes, open as thy heart,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But hark! I hear the distant drum:<br /></span>

<p>The Duke of Sussex was a worthy successor of his father, George III., in
the ranks of book-collectors, and his library is kept in memory by
Pettigrew's fine catalogue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Douce and Malone the critics, and Gough the antiquary, left their
libraries to the Bodleian, and thus many valuable books are available to
students in that much-loved resort of his at Oxford. Anthony Morris
Storer, who is said to have excelled in everything he set his heart on and
hand to, collected a beautiful library, which he bequeathed to Eton
College, where it still remains, a joy to look at from the elegance of the
bindings. His friend Lord Carlisle wrote of him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whether I Storer sing in hours of joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When every look bespeaks the inward boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or when no more mirth wantons in his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the man in him appears confest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mirth, in sadness, sing him how I will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sense and good nature must attend him still."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Jacob Bryant the antiquary left his library to King's College, Cambridge.
At one time he intended to have followed Storer's example, and have left
it to Eton College, but the Provost offended him, and he changed the
object of his bequest. It is said that when he was discussing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> matter,
the Provost asked whether he would not arrange for the payment of the
carriage of the books from his house to Eton. He thought this grasping,
and King's gained the benefit of his change of mind.</p>

<p>Among great authors two of the chief collectors were Scott and Southey.
Scott's library still remains at Abbotsford, and no one who has ever
entered that embodiment of the great man's soul can ever forget it. The
library, with the entire contents of the house, were restored to Scott in
1830 by his trustees and creditors, "As the best means the creditors have
of expressing their very high sense of his most honourable conduct, and in
grateful acknowledgment of the unparalleled and most successful exertions
he has made, and continues to make for them." The library is rich in the
subjects which the great author loved, such as Demonology and Witchcraft.
In a volume of a collection of Ballads and Chapbooks is this note written
by Scott in 1810: "This little collection of stall tracts and ballads was
formed by me, when a boy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> from the baskets of the travelling pedlars.
Until put into its present decent binding, it had such charms for the
servants, that it was repeatedly, and with difficulty, recovered from
their clutches. It contains most of the pieces that were popular about
thirty years since, and I dare say many that could not now be procured for
any price."</p>

<p>It is odd to contrast the book-loving tastes of celebrated authors.
Southey cared for his books, but Coleridge would cut the leaves of a book
with a butter knife, and De Quincey's extraordinary treatment of books is
well described by Mr. Burton in the <i>Book Hunter</i>. Charles Lamb's loving
appreciation of his books is known to all readers of the delightful Elia.</p>

<p>Southey collected more than 14,000 volumes, which sold in 1844 for nearly
&pound;3000. He began collecting as a boy, for his father had but few books. Mr.
Edwards enumerates these as follows: The <i>Spectator</i>, three or four
volumes of the <i>Oxford Magazine</i>, one volume of the <i>Freeholder's
Magazine</i>, and one of the <i>Town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> and Country Magazine</i>, Pomfret's <i>Poems</i>,
the <i>Death of Abel</i>, nine plays (including <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, <i>The Indian
Queen</i>, and a translation of <i>Merope</i>), and a pamphlet.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Southey was probably one of the most representative of literary men. His
feelings in his library are those of all book-lovers, although he could
express these feelings in language which few of them have at command:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Stevens read a paper or rather delivered an address at the
meeting of the Library Association held at Liverpool in 1883, containing
his recollections of Mr. James Lenox, the great American book collector. I
had the pleasure of listening to that address, but I have read it in its
finished form with even greater delight. It is not often that he who
pleases you as a speaker also pleases you as writer, but Mr. Stevens
succeeds in both. If more bibliographers could write their reminiscences
with the same spirit that he does, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> should hear less of the dullness of
bibliography. I strongly recommend my readers to take an early opportunity
of perusing this paper in the Liverpool volume of the Transactions of the
Library Association.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens, among his anecdotes of Mr. Lenox, records that he "often
bought duplicates for immediate use, or to lend, rather than grope for the
copies he knew to be in the stocks in some of his store rooms or chambers,
notably Stirling's <i>Artists of Spain</i>, a high-priced book."</p>

<p>This is a common trouble to large book collectors, who cannot find the
books they know they possess. The late Mr. Crossley had his books stacked
away in heaps, and he was often unable to lay his hands upon books of
which he had several copies.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/dc_a.png" width="120" height="121" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p>A discussion has arisen lately in bibliographical journals as to how best
to supply libraries with their books, the main principle agreed upon being
that it is the duty of the librarian to buy his books as cheaply as
possible. Some of these views are stated by Mr. H.R. Tedder in a letter
printed in the <i>Library Chronicle</i> for July, 1884 (vol. i. p. 120). It
appears that Professor Dziatzko contends that the books should always be
bought as cheaply as possible, but that Dr. Julius Petzholdt holds the
opinion that the chief object of the librarian should be to get his books
as early as possible and not to wait until they can be had at second-hand.
Mr. Tedder thinks that the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> plans of rapidity of supply and cheapness
of cost can in some respect be united. Of course there can be no
difference of opinion in respect to the duty of the librarian to get as
much for his money as he can, but there are other points which require to
be considered besides those brought forward before a satisfactory answer
to the question&mdash;How to Buy? can be obtained. There are three points which
seem to have been very much overlooked in the discussion, which may be
stated here. 1. Is the librarian's valuable time well occupied by looking
after cheap copies of books? 2. Will not the proposed action on the part
of librarians go far to abolish the intelligent second-hand bookseller in
the same way as the new bookseller has been well-nigh abolished in
consequence of large discounts? 3. Will not such action prevent the
publication of excellent books on subjects little likely to be popular?</p>

<p>1. Most librarians find their time pretty well occupied by the ordinary
duties of buying, arranging, cataloguing, and finding the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> books under
their charge, and it will be generally allowed that the librarian's first
duty is to be in his library, ready to attend to those who wish to consult
him. Now the value of his time can be roughly estimated for this purpose
in money, and the value of the time spent in doing work which could be as
well or better done by a bookseller should fairly be added to the cost of
the books.</p>

<p>2. It has hitherto been thought advisable to have one or more second-hand
booksellers attached to an important library, from whom the librarian may
naturally expect to obtain such books as he requires. Of course a man of
knowledge and experience must be paid for the exercise of these qualities,
but the price of books is so variable that it is quite possible that the
bookseller, from his knowledge, may buy the required books cheaper than
the librarian himself would pay for them. As far as it is possible to
judge from the information given us respecting the collection of
libraries, bookbuyers have little to complain of as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> the price paid by
them to such respectable booksellers as have acted as their agents.
Perhaps too little stress has been laid upon that characteristic which is
happily so common among honest men, viz. that the agent is as pleased to
get wares cheap for a good customer as for himself. Mr. Tedder says in his
letter, "For rarer books I still consider it safer and cheaper in the long
run to cultivate business relations with one or more second-hand
booksellers, and pay them for their knowledge and experience." But is this
quite fair, and is it not likely that the rarer books will be supplied
cheaper if the bookseller is allowed to pay himself partly out of the sale
of the commoner books, which it is now proposed the librarian shall buy
himself? My contention is that it is for the advantage of libraries that
intelligent booksellers, ready to place their knowledge at the service of
the librarians, should exist, and it is unwise and uneconomic to do that
which may cause this class to cease to exist. Sellers of books must always
exist, but it is possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> to drive out of the trade those who do it the
most honour. We see what has occurred in the new book trade, and there can
be little doubt that the book-buyer loses much more than he gains by the
present system of discount. When the bookseller could obtain sufficient
profit by the sale of new books to keep his shop open, it was worth his
while to take some trouble in finding the book required; but now that the
customer expects to buy a book at trade price, he cannot be surprised if
he does not give full particulars as to the publisher of the book he
requires if it is reported to him as "not known." Those only who, by
taking a large quantity of copies, obtain an extra discount, can make new
bookselling pay.</p>

<p>3. There are a large number of books which, although real additions to
literature, can only be expected to obtain a small number of readers and
buyers. Some of these are not taken by the circulating libraries, and
publishers, in making their calculations, naturally count upon supplying
some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> chief libraries of the country. If these libraries wait till
the book is second-hand, the number of sales is likely to be so much
reduced that it is not worth while to publish the book at all, to the
evident damage of the cause of learning.</p>

<p>It has been often suggested that an arrangement should be made by
libraries in close proximity, so that the same expensive book should not
be bought by more than one of the libraries. No doubt this is advantageous
in certain circumstances, but in the case of books with a limited sale it
would have the same consequence as stated above, and the book would not be
published at all, or be published at a loss.</p>

<p>Selden wrote in his <i>Table Talk</i>: "The giving a bookseller his price for
his books has this advantage; he that will do so, shall have the refusal
of whatsoever comes to his hand, and so by that means get many things
which otherwise he never should have seen." And the dictum is as true now
as it was in his time.</p>

<p>Many special points arise for consideration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> when we deal with the
question&mdash;How to buy at sales? and Mr. Edward Edwards gives the following
four rules for the guidance of the young book-buyer (<i>Memoirs of
Libraries</i>, vol. ii. p. 645):</p>

<p>1. The examination of books before the sale, not during it. 2. A steady
unintermittent bidding up to his predetermined limit, for all the books
which he wants, from the first lot to the last; and&mdash;if there be any signs
of a "combination"&mdash;for a few others which he may <i>not</i> want. 3. Careful
avoidance of all interruptions and conversation; with especial
watchfulness of the hammer immediately after the disposal of those
especially seductive lots, which may have excited a keen and spirited
competition. (There is usually on such occasions a sort of "lull," very
favourable to the acquisition of good bargains.) 4. The uniform
preservation and storing up of priced catalogues of all important sales
for future reference.</p>

<p>A case of conscience arises as to whether it is fit and proper for two
buyers to agree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> not to oppose each other at a public sale. Mr. Edwards
says, "At the sales Lord Spencer was a liberal opponent as well as a
liberal bidder. When Mason's books were sold, for example, in 1798, Lord
Spencer agreed with the Duke of Roxburghe that they would not oppose each
other, in bidding for some books of excessive rarity, but when both were
very earnest in their longings, "toss up, after the book was bought, to
see who should win it." Thus it was that the Duke obtained his unique, but
imperfect, copy of Caxton's <i>Historye of Kynge Blanchardyn and Prince
Eglantyne</i>, which, however, came safely to Althorp fourteen years later,
at a cost of two hundred and fifteen pounds; the Duke having given but
twenty guineas."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>It is easy to understand the inducement which made these two giants agree
not to oppose each other, but the agreement was dangerously like a
"knock-out." Mr. Henry Stevens (in his <i>Recollections of Mr. James<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Lenox</i>) boldly deals with this question, and condemns any such agreement.
He writes, "Shortly after, in 1850, there occurred for sale at the same
auction rooms a copy of '<i>Aratus, Phaenomena</i>,' Paris, 1559, in 4<sup>o</sup>, with
a few manuscript notes, and this autograph signature on the title, 'Jo.
Milton, Pre. 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> 1631.' This I thought would be a desirable
acquisition for Mr. Lenox, and accordingly I ventured to bid for it as far
as &pound;40, against my late opponent for the Drake Map, but he secured it at
&pound;40 10<i>s.</i>, remarking that 'Mr. Panizzi will not thank you for, thus
running the British Museum.' 'That remark,' I replied, 'is apparently one
of your gratuities. Mr. Panizzi is, I think, too much a man of the world
to grumble at a fair fight. He has won this time, though at considerable
cost, and I am sure Mr. Lenox will be the first to congratulate him on
securing such a prize for the British Museum.' 'I did not know you were
bidding for Mr. Lenox.' 'It was not necessary that you should.' 'Perhaps
at another time,' said he, 'we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> may arrange the matter beforehand, so as
not to oppose each other.' 'Very well,' I replied, 'if you will bring me a
note from Mr. Panizzi something to this effect: 'Mr. Stevens, please have
a knock-out with the bearer, the agent of the British Museum, on lot **,
and greatly oblige Mr. John Bull and your obdt. servant, A.P.,' I will
consider the proposition, and if Mr. Lenox, or any other of my interested
correspondents, is not unwilling to combine or conspire to rob or cheat
the proprietors, the 'thing' may possibly be done. Meanwhile, until this
arrangement is concluded, let us hold our tongues and pursue an honest
course.' That man never again suggested to me to join him in a
'knock-out.'"</p>

<p>In another place Mr. Stevens relates his own experience as to holding two
commissions, and the necessity of buying the book above the amount of the
lowest of the two. The circumstance relates to a copy of the small octavo
Latin edition of the <i>Columbus Letter</i>, in eight leaves, at the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Libri sale, Feb. 19, 1849. Mr. Stevens writes, "Mr. Brown ordered this lot
with a limit of 25 guineas, and Mr. Lenox of &pound;25. Now as my chief
correspondents had been indulged with a good deal of liberty, scarcely
ever considering their orders completely executed till they had received
the books and decided whether or not they would keep them, I grew into the
habit of considering all purchases my own until accepted and paid for.
Consequently when positive orders were given, which was very seldom, I
grew likewise into the habit of buying the lot as cheaply as possible, and
then awarding it to the correspondent who gave the highest limit. This is
not always quite fair to the owner; but in my case it would have been
unfair to myself to make my clients compete, as not unfrequently the
awarded lot was declined and had to go to another. Well, in the case of
this Columbus Letter, though I had five or six orders, I purchased it for
&pound;16 10<i>s.</i>, and, accordingly, as had been done many times before within
the last five or six years without a grumble,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> I awarded it to the highest
limit, and sent the little book to Mr. John Carter Brown. Hitherto, in
cases of importance, Mr. Lenox had generally been successful, because he
usually gave the highest limit. But in this case he rebelled. He wrote
that the book had gone under his commission of &pound;25, that he knew nobody
else in the transaction, and that he insisted on having it, or he should
at once transfer his orders to some one else. I endeavoured to vindicate
my conduct by stating our long-continued practice, with which he was
perfectly well acquainted, but without success. He grew more and more
peremptory, insisting on having the book solely on the ground that it went
under his limit. At length, after some months of negotiation, Mr. Brown,
on being made acquainted with the whole correspondence, very kindly, to
relieve me of the dilemma, sent the book to Mr. Lenox without a word of
comment or explanation, except that, though it went also below his higher
limit, he yielded it to Mr. Lenox for peace.... From that time I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
resorted, in cases of duplicate orders from them, to the expedient of
always putting the lot in at one bid above the lower limit, which, after
all, I believe is the fairer way in the case of positive orders. This
sometimes cost one of them a good deal more money, but it abated the
chafing and generally gave satisfaction. Both thought the old method the
fairest when they got the prize. But I was obliged, on the new system of
bidding, to insist on the purchaser keeping the book without the option of
returning it." There can be no doubt that the latter plan was the most
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Some persons appear to be under the impression that whatever a book
fetches at a public sale must be its true value, and that, as the
encounter is open and public, too much is not likely to be paid by the
buyer; but this is a great mistake, and prices are often realized at a
good sale which are greatly in advance of those at which the same books
are standing unsold in second-hand booksellers' shops.</p>

<p>Much knowledge is required by those who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> wish to buy with success at
sales. Books vary greatly in price at different periods, and it is a
mistake to suppose, from the high prices realized at celebrated sales,
which are quoted in all the papers, that books are constantly advancing in
price. Although many have gone up, many others have gone down, and at no
time probably were good and useful books to be bought so cheap as now. If
we look at old sale catalogues we shall find early printed books,
specimens of old English poetry and the drama, fetching merely a fraction
of what would have to be given for them now; but, on the other hand, we
shall find pounds then given for standard books which would not now
realize the same number of shillings; this is specially the case with
classics.</p>

<p>The following passage from Hearne's <i>Diaries</i> on the fluctuations in
prices is of interest in this connection:&mdash;"The editions of Classicks of
the first print (commonly called <i>editones principes</i>) that used to go at
prodigious prices are now strangely lowered; occasioned in good measure
by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> Mr. Thomas Rawlinson, my friend, being forced to sell many of his
books, in whose auction these books went cheap, tho' English history and
antiquities went dear: and yet this gentleman was the chief man that
raised many curious and classical books so high, by his generous and
courageous way of bidding."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>These first editions, however, realize large prices at the present time,
as has been seen at the sale of the Sunderland Library. It is experience
only that will give the necessary knowledge to the book buyer, and no
rules laid down in books can be of any real practical value in this case.
Persons who know nothing of books are too apt to suppose that what they
are inclined to consider exorbitant prices are matters of caprice, but
this is not so. There is generally a very good reason for the high price.</p>

<p>We must remember that year by year old and curious books become scarcer,
and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> number of libraries where they are locked up increase; thus while
the demand is greater, the supply diminishes, and the price naturally
becomes higher. A unique first edition of a great author is surely a
possession to be proud of, and it is no ignoble ambition to wish to obtain
it.</p>

<p>Libraries may broadly be divided into Public and Private, and as private
libraries will vary according to the special idiosyncrasies of their
owners, so still more will public libraries vary in character according to
the public they are intended for. The answer therefore to the
question&mdash;How to form a Public Library?&mdash;must depend upon the character of
the library which it is proposed to form. Up to the period when free town
libraries were first formed, collections of books were usually intended
for students; but when the Public Libraries' Acts were passed, a great
change took place, and libraries being formed for general readers, and
largely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> with the object of fostering the habit of reading, an entirely
new idea of libraries came into existence. The old idea of a library was
that of a place where books that were wanted could be found, but the new
idea is that of an educational establishment, where persons who know
little or nothing of books can go to learn what to read. The new idea has
naturally caused a number of points to be discussed which were never
thought of before.</p>

<p>But even in Town Libraries there will be great differences. Thus in such
places as Birmingham, Liverpool, and Manchester, the Free Libraries should
be smaller British Museums, and in this spirit their founders have worked;
but in smaller and less important towns a more modest object has to be
kept in view, and the wants of readers, more than those of consulters of
books, have to be considered.</p>

<p>Mr. Beriah Botfield has given a very full account of the contents of the
libraries spread about the country and associated with the different
Cathedrals in his <i>Notes on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> the Cathedral Libraries of England</i>, 1849.
These libraries have mostly been formed upon the same plan, and consist
very largely of the works of the Fathers, and of old Divinity. Some
contain also old editions of the classics, and others fine early editions
of English authors. In former times these libraries were much neglected,
and many of the books were lost; but the worst instance of injury to a
library occurred at Lincoln at the beginning of the present century, when
a large number of Caxtons, Pynsons, Wynkyn de Wordes, etc., were sold to
Dr. Dibdin, and modern books purchased for the library with the proceeds.
Dibdin printed a list of his treasures under the title of "The Lincolne
Nosegay." Mr. Botfield has reprinted this catalogue in his book.</p>

<p>The first chapter of the <i>United States Report on Public Libraries</i> is
devoted to Public Libraries a hundred years ago. Mr. H.E. Scudder there
describes some American libraries which were founded in the last century.
One of these was the Loganian Library of Philadelphia. Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> is an extract
from the will of James Logan, the founder&mdash;</p>

<p>"In my library, which I have left to the city of Philadelphia for the
advancement and facilitating of classical learning, are above one hundred
volumes of authors, in folio, all in Greek, with mostly their versions.
All the Roman classics without exception. All the Greek mathematicians,
viz. Archimedes, Euclid, Ptolemy, both his Geography and Almagest, which I
had in Greek (with Theon's Commentary, in folio, above 700 pages) from my
learned friend Fabricius, who published fourteen volumes of his
<i>Biblioth&egrave;que Grecque</i>, in quarto, in which, after he had finished his
account of Ptolemy, on my inquiring of him at Hamburgh, how I should find
it, having long sought for it in vain in England, he sent it to me out of
his own library, telling me it was so scarce that neither prayers nor
price could purchase it; besides, there are many of the most valuable
Latin authors, and a great number of modern mathematicians, with all the
three editions of Newton, Dr. Watts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> Halley, etc." The inscription on the
house of the Philadelphia Library is well worthy of repetition here. It
was prepared by Franklin, with the exception of the reference to himself,
which was inserted by the Committee.</p>

<p class='center'>
Be it remembered,<br />
in honor of the Philadelphia youth<br />
(then chiefly artificers),<br />
that in MDCCXXXI<br />
they cheerfully,<br />
at the instance of <span class="smcap">Benjamin Franklin</span>,<br />
one of their number,<br />
instituted the Philadelphia Library,<br />
which, though small at first,<br />
is become highly valuable and extensively useful,<br />
and which the walls of this edifice<br />
are now destined to contain and preserve:<br />
the first stone of whose foundation<br />
was here placed<br />
the thirty-first day of August, 1789.<br />
</p>

<p>Mr. F.B. Perkins, of the Boston Public Library, contributed to the
<i>Report on Public Libraries in the United States</i> a useful chapter on "How
to make Town Libraries successful" (pp. 419-430). The two chief points<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
upon which he lays particular stress, and which may be said to form the
texts for his practical remarks, are: (1) that a Public Library for
popular use must be managed not only as a literary institution, but also
as a business concern; and (2) that it is a mistake to choose books of too
thoughtful or solid a character. He says, "It is vain to go on the
principle of collecting books that people ought to read, and afterwards
trying to coax them to read them. The only practical method is to begin by
supplying books that people already want to read, and afterwards to do
whatever shall be found possible to elevate their reading tastes and
habits."</p>

<p>A series of articles on "How to Start Libraries in Small Towns" was
published in the <i>Library Journal</i> (vol. i. pp. 161, 213, 249, 313, 355,
421), and Mr. Axon's <i>Hints on the Formation of Small Libraries</i> has
already been mentioned. We must not be too rigid in the use of the term
Public Libraries, and we should certainly include under this description
those institutional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> Libraries which, although primarily intended for the
use of the Members of the Societies to which they belong, can usually be
consulted by students who are properly introduced.</p>

<p>Of Public Libraries first in order come the great libraries of a nation,
such as the British Museum. These are supplied by means of the Copyright
Law, but the librarians are not from this cause exonerated from the
troubles attendant on the formation of a library. There are old books and
privately printed and foreign books to be bought, and it is necessary that
the most catholic spirit should be displayed by the librarians. The same
may be said in a lesser degree of the great libraries of the more
important towns.</p>

<p>In England the Universities have noble libraries, more especially those of
Oxford and Cambridge, but although some colleges possess fine collections
of books, college libraries are not as a rule kept up to a very high
standard. The United States Report contains a full account of the college
libraries in America (pp. 60-126).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>The libraries of societies are to a large extent special ones, and my
brother, the late Mr. B.R. Wheatley, in a paper read before the
Conference of Librarians, 1877, entitled "Hints on Library Management, so
far as relates to the Circulation of Books," particularly alluded to this
fact. He wrote, "Our library is really a medical and surgical section of a
great Public Library. Taking the five great classes of literature, I
suppose medicine and its allied sciences may be considered as forming a
thirtieth of the whole, and, as our books number 30,000, we are, as it
were, a complete section of a Public Library of nearly a million volumes
in extent."</p>

<p>The United States Report contains several chapters on special libraries,
thus chapter 2 is devoted to those of Schools and Asylums; 4, to
Theological Libraries; 5, to Law; 6, to Medical; and 7, to Scientific
Libraries. For the formation of special libraries, special bibliographies
will be required, and for information on this subject reference should be
made to Chapter VI. of the present work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>When we come to deal with the Free Public Libraries, several ethical
questions arise, which do not occur in respect to other libraries. One of
the most pressing of these questions refers to the amount of Fiction read
by the ordinary frequenters of these libraries.</p>

<p>This point is alluded to in the United States Report on Public Libraries.
Mr. J.P. Quincy, in the chapter on Free Libraries (p. 389), writes,
"Surely a state which lays heavy taxes upon the citizen in order that
children may be taught to read is bound to take some interest in what they
read; and its representatives may well take cognizance of the fact that an
increased facility for obtaining works of sensational fiction is not the
special need of our country at the close of the first century of its
independence." He mentions a free library in Germanstown, Pa., sustained
by the liberality of a religious body, and frequented by artisans and
working people of both sexes. It had been in existence six years in 1876,
and then contained 7000 volumes. No novels are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> admitted into the library.
The following is a passage from the librarian's report of 1874: "In
watching the use of our library as it is more and more resorted to by the
younger readers of our community, I have been much interested in its
influence in weaning them from a desire for works of fiction. On first
joining the library, the new comers often ask for such books, but failing
to procure them, and having their attention turned to works of interest
and instruction, in almost every instance they settle down to good reading
and cease asking for novels. I am persuaded that much of this vitiated
taste is cultivated by the purveyors to the reading classes, and that they
are responsible for an appetite they often profess to deplore, but
continue to cater to, under the plausible excuse that the public will have
such works."</p>

<p>Mr. Justin Winsor in chapter 20 (Reading in Popular Libraries) expresses a
somewhat different view. He writes, "Every year many young readers begin
their experiences with the library. They find all the instructive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> reading
they ought to have in their school books, and frequent the library for
story books. These swell the issues of fiction, but they prevent the
statistics of that better reading into which you have allured the older
ones, from telling as they should in the average."</p>

<p>At the London Conference of Librarians (1877), Mr. P. Cowell, Librarian of
the Liverpool Public Library, read a paper on the admission of Fiction in
Free Public Libraries, where he discussed the subject in a very fair
manner, and deplored the high percentage of novel reading in these
libraries. At the Second Annual Meeting of the Library Association (1879)
Mr. J. Taylor Kay, Librarian of Owens College, Manchester, in his paper on
the Provision of Novels in Rate-supported Libraries, more completely
condemned this provision. He concluded his paper with these words:
"Clearly a hard and fast line must be drawn. A distinct refusal by the
library committees to purchase a single novel or tale would be appreciated
by the rate-payers. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> suggestion of a sub-committee to read this
literature would not be tolerated, and no man whose time is of value would
undergo the infliction. The libraries would attain their true position,
and the donations would certainly be of a higher class, if the aims of the
committees were known to be higher. Manchester has already curtailed its
issues of novels. It has been in the vanguard on the education question:
and let us hope it will be true to its traditions, to its noble impulses,
and lead the van in directing the educational influence of the free
libraries, and striking out altogether any expenditure in the
dissemination of this literature."</p>

<p>This question probably would not have come to the front if it were not
that the educational value of Free Libraries, as the complement of Board
Schools, has been very properly put forward by their promoters. With this
aim in view, it does startle one somewhat to see the completely
disproportionate supply of novels in the Free Libraries. This often rises
to 75 per cent. of the total supply, and in some libraries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> even a higher
percentage has been reached. There are, however, exceptions. At the
Baltimore Peabody Institute Fiction did not rise to more than one-tenth of
the total reading. The following are some figures of subjects circulated
at that library above 1000:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Cowell says that during the year ending 31st August, 1877, 453,585
volumes were issued at the reference library alone (Liverpool Free Public
Library); of these 170,531 were strictly novels. The high-percentage of
novel reading is not confined to Free Public Libraries, for we find that
in the Odd Fellows' Library of San Francisco,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> in 1874, 64,509 volumes of
Prose Fiction were lent out of a total of 78,219. The other high figures
being Essays, 2280; History, 1823; Biography and Travels, 1664. In the
College of the City of New York, of the books taken out by students
between Nov. 1876, and Nov. 1877, 1043 volumes were Novels, the next
highest numbers were Science, 153; Poetry, 133; History, 130.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In considering this question one naturally asks if the masterpieces of our
great authors, which every one should read, are to be mixed up with the
worthless novels constantly being published in the condemnation of
Fiction; but, to some extent, both Mr. Cowell and Mr. Kay answer this. The
first of these gentlemen writes: "As to the better class novels, which are
so graphic in their description of places, costumes, pageantry, men, and
events, I regret to say that they are not the most popular with those who
stand in need of their instructive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> descriptions. I could generally find
upon the library shelves 'Harold,' 'The Last of the Barons,' 'Westward
Ho!' 'Hypatia,' 'Ivanhoe,' 'Waverley,' 'Lorna Doone,' etc., when not a
copy of the least popular of the works of Mrs. Henry Wood, 'Ouida,' Miss
Braddon, or Rhoda Broughton were to be had." Mr. Kay corroborates this
opinion in his paper.</p>

<p>Most of us recognize the value of honest fiction for children and the
overwrought brains of busy men, but the reading of novels of any kind can
only be justified as a relaxation, and it is a sad fact that there is a
large class of persons who will read nothing but novels and who call all
other books dry reading. Upon the minds of this class fiction has a most
enervating effect, and it is not to be expected that ratepayers will
desire to increase this class by the indiscriminate supply of novels to
the Free Libraries. Some persons are so sanguine as to believe that
readers will be gradually led from the lower species of reading to the
higher; but there is little confirmation of this hope to be found in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> the
case of the confirmed novel readers we see around us.</p>

<p>The librarian who, with ample funds for the purpose, has the duty before
him of forming a Public Library, sets forward on a pleasant task. He has
the catalogues of all kinds of libraries to guide him, and he will be able
to purchase the groundwork of his library at a very cheap rate, for
probably at no time could sets of standard books be bought at so low a
price as now. Many books that are not wanted by private persons are
indispensable for a Public Library, and there being little demand for them
they can be obtained cheap. When the groundwork has been carefully laid,
then come some of the difficulties of collecting. Books specially required
will not easily be obtained, and when they are found, the price will
probably be a high one. Books of reference will be expensive, and as these
soon get out of date, they will frequently need renewal.</p>

<p>Treating of private libraries, it will be necessary to consider their
constitution under two heads, according as they are required in town or
country. In London, for instance, where libraries of all kinds are easily
accessible, a man need only possess books on his own particular hobby, and
a good collection of books of reference; but in the country, away from
public libraries, a well-selected collection of standard books will be
necessary.</p>


<p>1. <i>Town.</i></p>

<p>Every one who loves books will be sure to have some favourite authors on
special subjects of study respecting which he needs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> no instruction
farther than that which is ready to his hand. Books on these subjects he
will need, both in town and country, if he possesses two houses. Some
collectors make their town house a sort of gathering-place for the
accessions to their country libraries. Here a class is completed, bound,

<p>This is an age of books of reference, and as knowledge increases, and the
books which impart it to readers become unwieldy from their multitude,
there are sure to be forthcoming those who will reduce the facts into a
handy form. I have gathered in the following pages the titles of some of
the best books of reference which are to be obtained. Many, if not all of
these, are to be found in that magnificent library of reference&mdash;the
Reading Room of the British Museum. In some cases where the books are
constantly being reprinted, dates have been omitted. There are, doubtless,
many valuable works which I have overlooked,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> and some Text-books I have
had to leave out owing to the exigencies of space, but I trust that the
present list will be found useful.</p>

<p><i>Biography.</i>&mdash;Mr. Chancellor Christie contributed a very
interesting article to the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (April, 1884)
on Biographical Dictionaries, in which he details the
history of the struggle between the publishers of the
<i>Biographie Universelle</i> and Messrs. Didot, whose Dictionary
was eventually entitled <i>Nouvelle Biographie G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i>. The
new edition of the <i>Biographie Universelle</i> (45 vols. Imp.
8vo. Paris, 1854) is an invaluable work. Chalmers's
Biographical Dictionary (32 vols. 8vo. 1812-17) is a mine of
literary wealth, from which compilers have freely dug.
Rose's (12 vols. 8vo. 1848) was commenced upon a very
comprehensive plan, but the lives were considerably
contracted before the work was completed. It is, however, a
very useful work. L.B. Phillips's "Dictionary of
Biographical Reference" contains 100,000 names, and gives
the dates of birth and death, which in many instances is all
the information the consulter requires, and should more be
required, he is referred to the authority. This book is
quite indispensable for every library. There are several
national Biographical Dictionaries, and at last a thoroughly
satisfactory Biographia Britannica is in course of
publication by Messrs. Smith &amp; Elder. The "Dictionary of
National Biography, edited by Leslie Stephen," has reached
the fifth volume, and extends to Bottisham.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Men of the Time: a Dictionary of

Cooper. London, 1884. Sm. 8vo. A volume of 1168 pages should
contain a fair representation of the men of the day, and yet
it is ludicrously incomplete. The literary side is as much
overdone as the scientific side is neglected. This is not
the place to make a list of shortcomings, but it will
probably astonish most of our readers to learn that such
eminent Men of the Time as Sir Frederick Abel, Sir Frederick
Bramwell, and the late Dr. W.B. Carpenter are not mentioned.
As this book has as a high reputation, the editor should
thoroughly revise it for a new edition.</p>

more exhaustive list will shortly be published, as Mr.

believe, now engaged upon such a work. "Nomenclator

<p><a name="Dictionaries" id="Dictionaries"></a><i>Dictionaries.</i></p>

<p>(<i>English.</i>)&mdash;One of the most useful English Dictionaries is
the "Imperial Dictionary" by Ogilvie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> which has been edited
with great care by Charles Annandale.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The vocabulary is
very full, the etymology is trustworthy, and the definitions
are clear and satisfactory. The engravings which are
interspersed with the text are excellent, and greatly add to
the utility of the Dictionary.</p>

<p>For years preparations have been made for a Standard English
Dictionary, and at last the work has been commenced under
the able editorship of Dr. James A.H. Murray. In 1857, on
the suggestion of Archbishop Trench, the Philological
Society undertook the preparation of a Dictionary, "which by
the completeness of its vocabulary, and by the application
of the historical method to the life and use of words, might
be worthy of the English language and of English
scholarship." The late Mr. Herbert Coleridge and Dr.
Furnivall undertook the editorship, and a large number of
volunteers came forward to read books and extract
quotations. Mr. Coleridge died in the midst of his work, and
upon Dr. Furnivall devolved the entire editorship in
addition to his other onerous duties as Secretary of the
Philological Society. He projected the admirable system of
sub-editing, which proved so successful. As the work
proceeded several of the most energetic and most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> competent
workers undertook to sub-edit the materials already
collected, each one taking a separate letter of the
alphabet. Some two million quotations were amassed, but
still the man was wanting who would devote his life to
forming the Dictionary from these materials. In course of
time Dr. Murray came forward, and in 1878 he prepared some
specimens for submission to the Delegates of the Clarendon
Press, who agreed to publish the Dictionary. The first part
was published in 1884, and the second in 1885.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It is
hoped that in future it will be possible to issue a part
every six months. At present the alphabet is carried down to
Batten. This is one of the most magnificent pieces of work
that has ever been produced in any country, and it is an
honour to every one concerned. To the Philological Society
who conceived it, to Dr. Murray and his staff who have
devoted so much labour and intellect to its production, and
to the Clarendon Press who have published it to the world.
It is, moreover, an honour to the country which now
possesses a well-grounded hope of having, at no distant day,
the finest Historical Dictionary ever produced.</p>

<p>In this connection the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dic Dictionary</i>, now in
course of publication by Messrs. Cassell, should be
mentioned as a valuable work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to a few years ago it was impossible to obtain any
satisfactory etymological information on English words from
our Dictionaries. Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood partly removed this
reproach by the publication of his very valuable "Dictionary
of English Etymology" in 1859,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> but in this work Mr.
Wedgwood only dealt with a portion of the vocabulary.</p>

<p>Professor Skeat commenced the publication of his
indispensable "Etymological Dictionary of the English
Language" (Clarendon Press) in 1879, and in 1884 he produced
a second edition. In 1882 Professor Skeat published "A
Concise Etymological Dictionary," which is something more
than an abridgment, and a book which should find a place in
all libraries of reference.</p>

<p>A Glossarial Index to the Printed English Literature of the
Thirteenth Century. By H. Coleridge. London, 1859. 8vo. This
was one of the earliest publications which grew out of the
preparations for the great Philological Society's
Dictionary. Stratmann's Dictionary of the Old English
Language (third edition, Krefeld, 1878) is an indispensable
work. A new edition, prepared by Mr. H. Bradley, is about to
be issued by the Clarendon Press.</p>

<p>Of single volume Dictionaries, Mr. Hyde Clarke's "New and
Comprehensive Dictionary of the English Language as spoken
and written" in Weale's Educational Series (price 3<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>) is one of the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> valuable. I have time after time
found words there which I have searched for in vain in more
important looking Dictionaries. Mr. Clarke claims that he
was the first to raise the number of words registered in an
English Dictionary to 100,000.</p>

<p>The Rev. James Stormonth's "Dictionary of the English
Language, Pronouncing, Etymological, and Explanatory," is a
work of great value. It is so well arranged and printed that
it becomes a pleasure to consult it.</p>

<p>Those who are interested in Dialects will require all the
special Dictionaries which have been published, and these
may be found in the Bibliography now being compiled by the
English Dialect Society, but those who do not make this a
special study will be contented with "A Dictionary of
Archaic and Provincial Words, Obsolete Phrases, Proverbs,
and Ancient Customs, from the Fourteenth Century, by J.O.
Halliwell" (fifth edition, London, 1865, 2 vols. 8vo.),
which is well-nigh indispensable to all. Nares's Glossary
(1822-46, new edition, by J.O. Halliwell and T. Wright, 2
vols. 8vo. 1859) is also required by those who make a study
of Old English Literature.</p>


<p>The following is a short indication of some of the most
useful working Dictionaries:</p>

<p><i>Arabic.</i>&mdash;Lane.</p>

<p><i>Greek.</i>&mdash;Liddell &amp; Scott's Greek-English Lexicon, both in
4to. and in abridged form in square 12mo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Latin.</i>&mdash;The Clarendon Press publish a Latin Dictionary
founded on Andrews's edition of Freund, and edited by C.T.
Lewis and C. Short, which is of great value. Smith's
Dictionary, both the large edition and the smaller one, and
that of Riddle are good.</p>

<p><i>French.</i>&mdash;The Dictionaries of Fleming and Tibbins, and
Spiers, keep up their character, but for idioms the
International French and English Dictionary of Hamilton and
Legros is the best. For smaller Dictionaries Cassell's is
both cheap and good. Bellows's Pocket Dictionary has
obtained considerable fame, but those who use it need a good
eyesight on account of the smallness of the type. It is,
however, beautifully printed. The Standard French
Dictionaries of that language alone are the noble work of
Littr&eacute; and the excellent Dictionary of Poitevin (2 vols.
4to.). For early French Godefroy's elaborate work, which is
now in progress, must be consulted.</p>

<p><i>German.</i>&mdash;Fluegel's German and English Dictionary still
holds its own, but Koehler's Dictionary is also excellent.
Hilpert's and Lucas's Dictionaries, both good ones, are now
out of print. Of Standard German Dictionaries Grimm's great
work is still in progress. Sanders's Dictionary is also of
great value.</p>

<p><i>Danish and Norwegian.</i>&mdash;The Dictionary by Ferrall, Repp,
Rosing and Larsen is good.</p>

<p><i>Dutch.</i>&mdash;Calisch (2 vols. 8vo. 1875).</p>

<p><i>Hebrew.</i>&mdash;Fuerst, Gesenius.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Icelandic.</i>&mdash;Vigfusson.</p>

<p><i>Italian.</i>&mdash;Baretti's Dictionary still keeps up its
character, but Millhouse's work is also good.</p>

<p><i>Portuguese.</i>&mdash;Vieyra.</p>

<p><i>Russian.</i>&mdash;Alexandrow.</p>

<p><i>Sanscrit.</i>&mdash;Monier Williams. Boehtlingk and Roth.</p>

<p><i>P&acirc;li.</i>&mdash;Childers.</p>

<p><i>Spanish.</i>&mdash;Neumann and Baretti, and also Velasquez.</p>

<p><i>Swedish.</i>&mdash;Oman.</p>

<p>2. <i>Country.</i></p>

<p>A library in a large country house should contain a representative
collection of English literature, and also a selection of books of
reference from the previous list. Standard Authors, in their best
editions, County Histories, Books of Travel, Books on Art, and a
representative collection of good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> novels, will of course find a place
upon the shelves. A book such as Stevens's <i>My English Library</i> will be a
good guide to the foundation of the library, but each collector will have
his special tastes, and he will need guidance from the more particular
bibliographies which are ready to his hand, and a note of which will be
found in Chapter V. Room will also be found for sets of Magazines, such as
the <i>Gentleman's</i>, the <i>Edinburgh</i>, and the <i>Quarterly</i>, and for the
Transactions of such Societies as the owner may be member of. The issues
of Publishing Societies form quite a library of themselves, and an account
of these will be found in Chapter VII.</p>

<p>We have seen on a previous page how Napoleon wished to form a convenient
travelling library, in which everything necessary could be presented in a
comparatively small number of handy volumes. Few men are like Napoleon in
the wish to carry such a library about with them; but where space is
scarce there are many who find it necessary to exercise a wise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> spirit of
selection. This, however, each man must do for himself, as tastes differ
so widely.</p>

<p>Auguste Comte succeeded in selecting a library in which all that it is
necessary for a Positivist to know is included in 150 volumes, but this
result is obtained by putting two or more books together to form one
volume.</p>

<p>This is an interesting list as having been compiled with special thought
by a celebrated man, but in many of its details it is little likely to
find acceptance with the general reader. It seems rather odd to an
Englishman to find the <i>Princess of Cleves</i> included, while Shakespeare is
only to be found in a selection of his plays. It is not Comte's fault that
science has not stood still since 1854, and that his selection of books is
rather out of date.</p>

<p>A list of a hundred good novels is likely to be useful to many, but few
lists would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> open to more criticism, for readers differ more as to what
constitutes a good novel than upon any other branch of literature. The
following list was contributed by Mr. F.B. Perkins to the <i>Library
Journal</i> (vol. i. p. 166). The titles are very short, and they are put
down in no particular order. Most of us will miss some favourite book, but
two people, Mr. Perkins says, have agreed on this list within four or five
items. He says he was tempted to add a few alternatives, as Amadis de
Gaul, Morte d'Arthur, Paul and Virginia, Frankenstein, Rasselas, etc.</p>

<p>A good collection of bibliographies is indispensable for a public library,
and will also be of great use in a private library when its possessor is a
true lover of books. One of the most valuable catalogues of this class of
books is the "Hand-List of Bibliographies, Classified Catalogues, and
Indexes placed in the Reading Room of the British Museum for Reference"
(1881). It is not intended to give in this chapter anything like a
complete account of these books, as a separate volume would be required to
do justice to them. Here it will be sufficient to indicate some of the
foremost works in the class. The catalogues of some of our chief libraries
are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> amongst the most valuable of bibliographies for reference. The
Catalogue of the Library of the London Institution is one of the
handsomest ever produced.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Unfortunately the cost of production was too
great for the funds of the Institution, and the elaborate Catalogue of
Tracts was discontinued after the letter F.</p>

<p>The London Library being a specially well-selected one, the catalogue
(which is a good example of a short-titled catalogue) is particularly
useful for ready reference.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The Royal Institution Library is very rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> in British Topography, and the
catalogue forms a convenient handbook.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The Catalogue of the Patent Office Library is by no means a model, but the
second volume forms a good book of reference.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Many other catalogues
might be mentioned, but these will be sufficient for our present purpose.
There is great want of a good Handbook of Literature, with the prices of
the different books. Until this want is supplied good booksellers'
catalogues will be found the most trustworthy guides. Pre-eminent among
these are the catalogues of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> Mr. Quaritch, and the "Catalogue of upwards
of fifty thousand volumes of ancient and modern books," published by
Messrs. Willis and Sotheran in 1862. Mr. Quaritch's catalogues are
classified with an index of subjects and authors.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> A previous General
Catalogue was issued in 1874, and a Supplement 1875-77 (pp. iv. 1672). Now
Mr. Quaritch is issuing in sections a new Catalogue on a still larger
scale, which is of the greatest value.</p>

<p>For the study of early printed books, Hain,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Panzer,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and
Maittaire's<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> books are indispensable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>For general literature Brunet's Manual<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> stands pre-eminent in its
popularity. It has held its own since 1810, when it was first published in
three volumes, demy octavo. Graesse's Tr&eacute;sor<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> is less known out of
Germany, but it also is a work of very great value. Ebert's work<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> is
somewhat out of date now, but it still has its use. Watt's Bibliotheca<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
is one of the most valuable bibliographies ever published, chiefly on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
account of the index of subjects which gives information that cannot be
found elsewhere. The titles were largely taken from second-hand sources,
and are in many instances marred by misprints. Every one who uses it must
wish that it was brought down to date, but it is scarcely likely that any
one will sacrifice a life to such labour as would be necessary. Moreover,
the popular feeling is somewhat adverse to universal bibliographies, and
it is thought that the literature of his own country is sufficiently large
a subject for the bibliographer to devote his time to.</p>

<p>English literature has not been neglected by English bibliographers,
although a full bibliography of our authors is still a crying want.
Complete lists of the works of some of our greatest authors have still to
be made, and it is to be hoped that all those who have the cause of
bibliography at heart will join to remedy the great evil. It would be
quite possible to compile a really national work by a system of
co-operation such as was found workable in the case of the Philological<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Society's Dictionary of the English Language. Sub-editors of the different
letters might be appointed, and to them all titles could be sent. When the
question of printing arose, it would be well to commence with the chief
authors. These bibliographies might be circulated, by which means many
additions would be made to them, and then they could be incorporated in
the general alphabet. In such a bibliography books in manuscript ought to
be included, as well as printed books. Although there is little doubt that
many books still remain unregistered, we are well supplied with catalogues
of books made for trade purposes. Maunsell<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> was the first to publish
such a list, and in 1631 was published a catalogue of books issued between
1626 and 1631.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> William <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> London<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> published his Catalogue in 1658,
and Clavell's his in 1696.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Bent's Catalogue, published in 1786, went
back to 1700,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and this was continued annually as the London Catalogue.
The British and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> English Catalogues<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> followed, and the latter is also
published annually.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>For early printed books, Ames and Herbert's great work<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> is of much
value, but information respecting our old literature has increased so much
of late that a new history of typographical antiquities is sadly needed.
Mr. Blades has done the necessary work for Caxton, but the first English
printer's successors require similar treatment.</p>

<p>William Thomas Lowndes, the son of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> an eminent bookseller and publisher,
and himself a bookseller, published in 1834 his <i>Bibliographer's
Manual</i><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> which has remained the great authority for English Literature.
It had become very scarce when Henry Bohn, in 1857, brought out a new
edition with additions in a series of handy volumes, which is an
indispensable book of reference, although it is far from being the
complete work that is required.</p>

<p>Allibone's <i>Dictionary</i><a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> contains much that is omitted in Lowndes's
Manual, but it is more literary than bibliographical in its scope. The
well-selected criticisms appended to the titles of the several books are
of considerable interest and value to the reader. Mr. W.C. Hazlitt's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Handbooks<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> are exceedingly valuable as containing information
respecting a class of books which has been much neglected in
bibliographical works. The compiler has been indefatigable for some years
past in registering the titles of rare books as they occurred at public
sales.</p>

<p>Mr. Collier's account of rare books,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> founded on his Bridgewater
Catalogue (1837), is of great use for information respecting
out-of-the-way literature, as also is Mr. Corser's descriptive Catalogue
of Old English Poetry.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Accounts of books published in Gaelic,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> in Welsh,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and in Irish,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
have been published. The works of American authors are included in
Allibone's <i>Dictionary</i>, referred to under English literature, but special
books have also been prepared, such as Tr&uuml;bner's Guide,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Stevens's
American Books in the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> Museum,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and Leypoldt's great book, the
American Catalogue.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Catalogues of Books on America, such as those of
Obadiah Rich, have also been compiled, but these are more properly special
bibliographies. France has always stood in a foremost position in respect
to bibliography, and she alone has a national work on her literature,
which stands in the very first rank&mdash;this is due to the enthusiastic
bibliographer Querard.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> A better model as to what a national<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
bibliography should be could not well be found. The catalogue of current
literature, which bears the name of O. Lorenz, is also an excellent
work.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>German literature has been, and is, well registered. Heyse,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Maltzahn,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Heinsius,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and Kayser,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> have all produced valuable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
works. Heinsius published his original Lexicon in 1812, and Kayser his in
1834, and Supplements to both of these have been published about every ten
years. A more condensed work was commenced by A. Kirchhoff in 1856,
containing the catalogue of works published from 1851 to 1855; a second
volume of the next five years appeared in 1861, and since Kirchhoff's
death Hinrichs has published a volume every five years. The Leipzig
Book-fairs have had their catalogues ever since 1594, and the half-yearly
volumes now bearing the name of Hinrichs,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> which have been published
regularly since 1798, and to which the Fair catalogues succumbed in 1855,
may be considered as their legitimate successors.</p>

<p>The Literature of Holland is well recorded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> by Campbell<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and
Abkoude,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and for Belgium there is the <i>Bibliographie de Belgique</i>.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
Italy can boast of a Gamba<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and a Bertocci,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> a public office
publishes the <i>Bibliografia Italiana</i>.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Spain is fortunate in possessing a splendid piece of bibliography in the
great works of Antonio.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Some years ago, when I was occupied in
cataloguing one of the chief collections of Spanish books in this country,
I was in the daily habit of consulting these <i>Bibliothecas</i>, and while
comparing the books themselves with the printed titles, I seldom found a
mistake. Hidalgo's<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> work and the Boletin<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> show that at the present
time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> bibliography is not neglected in that country.</p>

<p>The works of Barbosa Machado<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and Silva<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> show that Portugal is not
behind the sister kingdom in the love for bibliography.</p>

<p>Bibliographies of other countries might be mentioned here, but space will
not permit. There is one branch of general bibliography to which special
attention has been paid for a long period of years. O. Placcius published
his <i>Theatrum Anonymorum et Pseudonymorum</i> at Hamburgh in 1674 (2nd ed.
1708). Villani continued the record of pseudonymous literature by
publishing at Parma, in 1689, a small volume entitled <i>La Visiera alzata</i>.
J.C. Mylius published his <i>Bibliotheca Anonymorum et Pseudonymorum</i> at
Hamburgh in 1740.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>Barbier's great work on the Anonymous in French Literature was first
published in 1806-8, the second edition appeared in 1822-27, and the third
in 1872-78, as a continuation to the second edition of Querard's <i>Les
Supercheries Litt&eacute;raires</i>. Querard's work is more curious than useful,
because the author has entered into minute questions of authorship which
do not really belong to the domain of bibliography. Manne's volume (1834)
is not of much value. Lancetti published an octavo volume on Pseudonyms in
Italian (1836), but Barbier's work was not worthily imitated in any other
country until Mr. Paterson commenced the publication of the very valuable
work of the late Mr. Halkett.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Bibliographies of special subjects are more useful than any other books in
the formation of a library. The articles in the new edition of the
<i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> will be found valuable for this purpose, but
those who wish for fuller information must refer to Dr. Julius Petzholdt's
elaborate <i>Bibliotheca Bibliographica</i> (Leipzig, 1866), or to the
<i>Bibliographie des Bibliographies</i> of M. L&eacute;on Vall&eacute;e (Paris, 1885). The
late Mr. Cornelius Walford contributed a paper "On Special Collections of
Books" to the Transactions of the Conference of Librarians, 1877 (pp.
45-49), in which he specially referred to the subject of Insurance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>In the present chapter I propose to refer to some of the most useful
bibliographies, but to save space the full titles will not be given, and
this is the less necessary as they can mostly be found in the above books
or in that useful little volume we owe to the authorities of the British
Museum&mdash;"Hand-list of Bibliographies, Classified Catalogues, and Indexes
placed in the Reading-room," 1881.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;Weston's Tracts on Practical Agriculture and
Gardening (1773), contains a Chronological Catalogue of
English Authors, and Donaldson's Agricultural Biography
(1854) brings the subject down to a later date. Victor
Donatien de Musset-Pathay published a <i>Bibliographie
Agronomique</i> in 1810, and Loudon's <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia of
Agriculture</i> contains the Literature and Bibliography of
Agriculture, British, French, German, and American.</p>

<p><i>Ana.</i>&mdash;In Peignot's <i>Repertoire de Bibliographies
Sp&eacute;ciales</i> (1810) will be found at pp. 211-268, a list of
books of Ana, and Gabriel Antoine Joseph H&eacute;cart published at
Valenciennes, 1821, under the name of J.G. Phitakaer, a
bibliography entitled "Anagrapheana." Namur's <i>Bibliographie
des Ouvrages publi&eacute;s sous le nom d'Ana</i> was published at
Bruxelles in 1839. The late Sir William Stirling Maxwell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
made a collection of books of Ana, a privately printed
catalogue of which he issued in 1860.</p>

<p><i>Angling.</i>&mdash;Sir Henry Ellis printed privately in 1811 a
small octavo pamphlet of 21 pages which he entitled "A
Catalogue of Books on Angling, with some brief notices of
several of their authors," which was an extract from the
<i>British Bibliographer</i>. In 1836, Pickering printed a
<i>Bibliotheca Piscatoria</i>, which was formed upon Sir Henry
Ellis's corrected copy of the above Catalogue. Mr. J.
Russell Smith published in 1856 "A Bibliographical Catalogue
of English writers on Angling and Ichthyology," which was
soon superceded by the following work by Mr. T. Westwood. "A
new Bibliotheca Piscatoria, or a general Catalogue of
Angling and Fishing Literature." London, 1861 (another
edition, edited conjointly with T. Satchell, 1883). Mr. R.
Blakey published in 1855, "Angling Literature of all
Nations." London, 1855. 12mo. Mr. J.J. Manley, M.A.,
published in 1883, "Literature of Sea and River Fishing," as
one of the Handbooks of the International Fisheries
Exhibition.</p>

<p><i>Architecture.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lacroix</span> (E.). Bibliographie des Ing&eacute;nieurs,
des Architectes, des Chefs d'Usines industrielles, des
El&egrave;ves des Ecoles polytechniques et professionnelles et des
Agriculteurs. Premi&egrave;re (&mdash;Troisi&egrave;me) S&eacute;rie. Paris, 1864-67.
4to.</p>

<p><i>Assurance</i> (<i>Life</i>).&mdash;Lewis Pocock published "A
Chronological List of Books and Single Papers" relating to
this subject in 1836, a second edition of which was
published in 1842.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Astronomy.</i>&mdash;Lalande published his valuable "Bibliographie
Astronomique" at Paris, 1803. Otto Struve's Catalogue of the
Library of the Pulkova Observatory, published at St.
Petersburg in 1860, is highly esteemed by astronomers. The
first part of the Catalogue of the United States Naval
Observatory at Washington, by Prof. E.S. Holden, is devoted
to Astronomical Bibliography.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; <span class="smcap">Houzeau</span> (J.C.) and <span class="smcap">Lancaster</span> (A.), Bibliographie
g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Astronomie. Bruxelles, 1880. 8vo. In progress.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Mr. E.B. Knobel, Secretary of the Royal Astronomical
Society, printed in the <i>Monthly Notices</i> of that Society
for November, 1876 (pp. 365-392), a very useful short
Reference Catalogue of Astronomical Papers and Researches,
referring more especially to (1) Double Stars; (2) Variable
Stars; (3) Red Stars; (4) Nebul&aelig; and Clusters; (5) Proper
Motions of Stars; (6) Parallax and Distance of Stars; (7)
Star Spectra. Mr. E.S. Holden's "Index Catalogue of Books
and Memoirs relating to Nebul&aelig; and Clusters of Stars" was
printed in the <i>Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections</i> in
1877.</p>

<p><i>Bible.</i>&mdash;The famous Le Long published at Paris, in 1713,
his "Discours historiques sur les principales &eacute;ditions des
Bibles polyglottes," and in 1723, in two volumes, folio, his
great work "Bibliotheca Sacra." This was edited and
continued by A.G. Masch, and published at Hal&aelig; Magd. in
five volumes, quarto.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> 1774-97. T. Llewelyn published in
1768 "Historical Account of the British or Welsh Versions
and editions of the Bible." A privately printed "List of
various editions of the Bible" was issued in 1778, which has
been attributed to Dr. Ducarel. John Lewis's "Complete
History of the several Translations of the Holy Bible and
New Testament into English" was published in 1818, and Dr.
Henry Cotton's "List of Editions" (Oxford, 1821, 2nd
edition, 1852) was intended as an Appendix to that work.
Orme's <i>Bibliotheca Biblica</i> was published at Edinburgh in
1824, and Hartwell Horne's <i>Manual of Biblical Bibliography</i>
at London in 1839. Bagster's <i>Bible in Every Land</i> (1848),
although not strictly bibliographical, must be mentioned
here, because it gives under each language a notice of all
versions published in that language. Lowndes' British
Librarian or Book Collector's Guide. Class I. Religion and
its History. London, 1839. 8vo. Parts 1, 2, 3 are devoted to
Holy Scriptures, Biblical Commentaries, Biblical
Disquisitions, Scripture Biography, Scripture Geography,
etc. The work itself was left incomplete Dr. H. Cotton
published at Oxford, in 1855, a work entitled "Rhemes and
Doway. An Attempt to show what has been done by Roman
Catholics for the diffusion of the Holy Scriptures in
English." In 1859 J.G. Shea published at New York a
"Bibliographical Account of Catholic Bibles, Testaments, and
other portions of Scripture translated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> from the Latin
Vulgate, and printed in the United States," and in 1861 E.B.
O'Callaghan published at Albany a "List of editions of
the Holy Scriptures and parts thereof, printed in America
previous to 1860." E. Reuss published at Brunswick, in 1872,
a Bibliography of the Greek New Testament. Dr. Isaac Hall
printed a Critical Bibliography of American Greek Testaments
at Philadelphia in 1883. Mr. Henry Stevens, the eminent
bibliographer, is a special authority on Bibles, and his
work, entitled "The Bibles in the Caxton Exhibition, 1877,
or a bibliographical description of nearly one thousand
representative Bibles in various languages, chronologically
arranged" (London, 1878), contains some of the information
he possesses.</p>

<p><i>Biography.</i>&mdash;Oettinger's <i>Bibliographie Biographique
Universelle</i> (1854) is a most useful work, although it is
now unfortunately somewhat out of date.</p>

<p><i>Book-keeping.</i>&mdash;B.F. Foster's <i>Origin and Progress of
Book-keeping</i> (1852) contains an account of books published
on this subject from 1543 to 1852.</p>

<p><i>Botany.</i>&mdash;Pritzel's <i>Thesaurus Literatur&aelig; Botanic&aelig;</i> (1851,
another edition 1872-77) is <i>the</i> Bibliography of the
subject, and this work is supplemented by Mr. Daydon
Jackson's Index of Botany, published by the Index Society.
Trimen's Botanical Bibliography of the British counties,
London, 1874. 8vo.</p>

<p><i>Classics.</i>&mdash;Dr. Edward Harwood published his "View of the
various editions of the Greek and Roman Classics" in 1790.
He was followed in 1802 by Thomas Frognall Dibdin, whose
work was much enlarged, and reappeared in several editions;
the fourth and best being published in 1827 (2 vols. 8vo.).
J.W. Moss published his "Manual of Classical Bibliography"
in 1825, 2 vols. 8vo. Henry G. Bohn's General Catalogue,
Part II. Section I. 1850, contains a valuable list of Greek
and Latin Classics. Engelmann's Bibliotheca Scriptorum
Classicorum et Gr&aelig;corum et Latinorum (1858) is an elaborate
work on the subject, and Professor John E.B. Mayor's
translation and adaptation of Dr. H&uuml;bner's Bibliographical
Clue to Latin Literature will be found to be a very useful
handbook.</p>

<p><i>Commerce.</i>&mdash;See <i><a href="#Trade_and_Finance">Trade</a></i>.</p>

<p><i>Dialects.</i>&mdash;Mr. J. Russell Smith published, in 1839, a
useful "Bibliographical List of the Works that have been
published towards illustrating the Provincial Dialects of
England" (24 pages). When the Rev. Professor Skeat started
the English Dialect Society, he at once laid the foundation
of an extensive Bibliographical List to include MSS. as well
as printed works. This Bibliography is being published by
the Society in parts.</p>

<p><a name="Dictionaries2" id="Dictionaries2"></a><i>Dictionaries.</i>&mdash;William Marsden printed privately, in 1796,
a valuable "Catalogue of Dictionaries, Vocabularies,
Grammars, and Alphabets."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dictionaries.</i>&mdash;Tr&uuml;bner's Catalogue of Dictionaries and
Grammars (1872, second edition 1882) is a very useful work.
H.B. Wheatley's account of English Dictionaries was
published in the Transactions of the Philological Society
for 1865.</p>

<p><i>Drama.</i>&mdash;A notice of some books in the English Drama will
be found in Chapter IV. The <i>Biblioth&egrave;que Dramatique de
Mons. de Soleinne</i> (1843-44, 5 vols.), with its continuation
to 1861, is a splendid Catalogue, in which the books are
fully described, with valuable notes and preface.</p>

<p><i>Earthquakes.</i>&mdash;Mr. Robert Mallet's Bibliography of
Earthquakes will be found in the British Association Report
for 1858, and Mons. Alexis Perrey's Bibliographie Seismique
in the Dijon <i>Memoires</i> for 1855, 1856, and 1861.</p>

<p><i>Electricity.</i>&mdash;Sir Francis Ronalds' Catalogue of Books and
Papers relating to Electricity, Magnetism, and the Electric
Telegraph (1880) contains a large number of titles. O.
Salle's Bibliography of Electricity and Magnetism, 1860 to
1883, was published in 1884.</p>

<p><i>Entomology.</i>&mdash;Dr. Hagen's Bibliotheca Entomologica
(Leipzig, 1862-63) is a carefully compiled and useful book.</p>

<p><i>Epigrams.</i>&mdash;There is a list of books connected with
Epigrammatic Literature appended to <i>The Epigrammatists</i>, by

<p>(<i>Great Britain and Ireland.</i>)&mdash;Bishop Nicholson's English,
Scotch, and Irish Historical Libraries, 1776, will still be
found useful. Mr. Mullinger's portion of the Introduction to
the Study of English History (1881) gives the latest
information on the subject. Sir Duffus Hardy's "Descriptive

Britain and Ireland to the end of the reign of Henry VIII."

<p><i>Law.</i>&mdash;Mr. Stephen R. Griswold contributed an article on
Law Libraries to the U.S. Report on Libraries (pp. 161-170).
He writes, "Law books may be classified generally as
follows: Reports, Treatises, Statute Law. The practice of
reporting the decisions of the Judges began in the reign of
Edward I., and from that time we have a series of judicial
reports of those decisions. In the time of Lord Bacon, these
reports extended to fifty or sixty volumes. During the two
hundred and fifty years that have passed since then, nothing
has been done by way of revision or expurgation; but these
publications have been constantly increasing, so that at
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> close of the year 1874 the published volumes of reports
were as follows: English, 1350 volumes; Irish, 175 volumes;
Scotch, 225 volumes; Canadian, 135 volumes; American, 2400
volumes. With respect to treatises (including law
periodicals and digests), and without including more than
one edition of the same work, it is safe to say that a fair
collection would embrace at least 2000 volumes. The statute
law of the United States, if confined to the general or
revised statutes and codes, may be brought within 100
volumes. If, however, the sessional acts be included, the
collection would amount to over 1500 volumes. It is thus
seen that a fairly complete law library would embrace more
than 7000 volumes, which could not be placed upon its
shelves for less than $50,000."</p>

<p><i>Law.</i>&mdash;There is a useful list of legal bibliographies in
the "Hand-list of Bibliographies in the Reading-room of the
British Museum" (pp. 40-44). Clarke's <i>Bibliotheca Legum</i>,
which was compiled by Hartwell Horne (1819), is a valuable
work. Marvin's <i>Legal Bibliography</i>, which was published at
Philadelphia in 1847, contains 800 pages. The Catalogue of
the Law Library in the New York State Library (1856), forms
a useful guide to the subject, and Herbert G. Sweet's
"Complete Catalogue of Modern Law Books" is one of the
latest catalogues of authority.</p>

<p><i>Mathematics.</i>&mdash;A really good bibliography of Mathematics is
still wanting. The following books, however, all from
Germany, are useful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mathematics.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Murhard</span> (F.W.A.). Bibliotheca Mathematica.
Lipsi&aelig;, 1797-1804. 4 vols.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; <span class="smcap">Rogg</span> (J.). Handbuch der Mathematischen Literatur.
T&uuml;bingen, 1830.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; <span class="smcap">Sohncke</span> (L.A.). Bibliotheca Mathematica. 1830-54.
Leipsic, 1854.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; <span class="smcap">Erlecke</span> (A.). Bibliotheca Mathematica. Halle-a.-S.,
1873.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Professor De Morgan's Arithmetical Books (1847) is a
model of what a good bibliography ought to be.</p>

<p><i>Medical.</i>&mdash;Dr. Billings contributed a chapter on "Medical
Libraries in the United States" to the U.S. Report on Public
Libraries (pp. 171-182), in which he wrote&mdash;"The record of
the researches, experiences, and speculations relating to
Medical Science during the last four hundred years is
contained in between two and three hundred thousand volumes
and pamphlets; and while the immense majority of these have
little or nothing of what we call 'practical value,' yet
there is no one of them which would not be called for by
some inquirer if he knew of its existence." The writer added
a list of works of reference which should be in every
Medical Library.</p>

<p>There have been a specially large number of Medical
Bibliographies, from Haller's works downwards. James
Atkinson's Medical Bibliography (1834, A and B only), is an
amusing book, but of little or no utility. The most useful
books are Dr. Billings's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> Index Catalogue of the Library of
the Surgeon-General's Office (Washington, 1880) and the
Catalogue of the Library of the Royal Medical and
Chirurgical Society (3 vols. 1879), by B.R. Wheatley.
Neale's Medical Digest (1877) forms a convenient guide to
the medical periodicals. The two great French
dictionaries&mdash;Raige-Delorme and A. Dechambre, Dictionnaire
Encyclop&eacute;dique des Sciences M&eacute;dicales (4 series, commenced
in 1854, and still in progress); Jaccoud, Nouveau
Dictionnaire de M&eacute;decine et de Chirurgie Pratiques (1864,
and still in progress)&mdash;contain very valuable references to
the literature of the various subjects. Of special subjects
may be mentioned H. Haeser's Bibliotheca Epidemiographica
(1843), John S. Billings's Bibliography of Cholera in the
Report of the Cholera Epidemic of 1873 in the United States
(1875, pp. 707-1025), Beer's Bibliotheca Ophthalmica (1799),
Dr. E.J. Waring's Bibliotheca Therapeutica (1878-79, 2
vols. 8vo.), and Bibliography of Embryology, in Balfour's
Embryology, vol. ii.</p>

<p><i>Meteorology.</i>&mdash;A full bibliography of books and papers upon
Meteorology is being prepared at the United States Signal
Office, and it is reported that 48,000 titles are now in the
office. There have been several articles on this subject in
<i>Symons's Meteorological Magazine</i>, the last being in the
number for December, 1885.</p>

<p><i>Mineralogy.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dana</span> (J.D.). Bibliography of Mineralogy.
1881. 8vo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

essays, letters, paragraphs, and numerous Patent
Specifications, with an Introductory Essay. By Henry Dircks,

Bibliographical Account of the Musical and Poetical Works
published in England during the 16th and 17th centuries,
under the titles of Madrigals, Ballets, Ayres, Canzonets,
etc. London, 1847. 8vo.</p>

<p>There are bibliographies of the subject in F.L. Kilter's
History of Music, London, 1876, and F. Clement, Histoire
g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la Musique Religieuse. Paris, 1861.</p>

<p><i>Natural History.</i>&mdash;Dryander's Catalogue of Sir Joseph
Banks's Library, now in the British Museum, is the most
famous bibliography of this subject, although made so many
years ago. It consists of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> 5 vols. 8vo. (1798-1800). Vol. 1,
General Writers; Vol. 2, Zoology; Vol. 3, Botany; Vol. 4,

<p><i>Political Economy.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">McCulloch</span> (J.R.) The Literature of
Political Economy, London, 1845.&mdash;This is a very valuable
work up to the date of publication, but a good bibliography
of the subject is still a desideratum. The late Professor
Stanley Jevons proposed to draw up a Handy Book of the
Literature for the Index Society, but, to the great loss of
bibliography, was prevented by other work from undertaking
it. He contributed a list of Selected Books in Political
Economy to the <i>Monthly Notes</i> of the Library Association
(Vol. 3, No. 7).</p>

<p><i>Poor.</i>&mdash;A Catalogue of Publications in the English Language
on subjects relative to the Poor will be found in Eden's
<i>State of the Poor</i>, vol. iii. pp. ccclxvii&mdash;ccclxxxvi.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is a list of some of the bibliographies of the productions
of the chief printers:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Aldus.</i>&mdash;Annales de l'Imprimerie des Alde ou Histoire des

<p><i>Caxton.</i>&mdash;The Life and Typography of William Caxton,
England's first Printer, with evidence of his typographical
connection with Colard Mansion, the Printer at Bruges.
Compiled from original sources by William Blades. London,
1861-63. 2 vols. 4to. A condensed edition was published
under the following title: The Biography and Typography of
William Caxton, England's first Printer. By William Blades.

Histoire de la Famille, des Estienne et de ses &eacute;ditions. Par
A.A. Renouard. Paris, 1837-38. 8vo. 2 parts.</p>

<p><i>Privately Printed Books.</i>&mdash;The second edition of John
Martin's Bibliographical Catalogue of Privately Printed
Books was published in 1854, and a newer work on this
important subject is much required. Mr. W.P. Courtney has
been engaged in the production of such a work for some
years, and the labour could not be in better hands.</p>

<p><i>Proverbs.</i>&mdash;The <i>Bibliographie Par&eacute;miologique</i> of Pierre
Alexandre Gratet-Duplessis (1847), is one of the most
elaborate and carefully compiled bibliographies ever
published. Sir William Stirling Maxwell printed privately a
catalogue of his collection of books of proverbs, in which
were specially marked those unknown to Duplessis, or those
published since the issue of his catalogue.</p>

<p><i>Science.</i>&mdash;An article on the Scientific Libraries in the
United States was contributed by Dr. Theodore Gill to the
U.S. Report on Public Libraries (pp. 183-217). It contains
an account of the various periodical records of work in the
various departments of science.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Shorthand.</i>&mdash;Thomas Anderson's History of Shorthand, London
(1882), contains Lists of Writers on Shorthand in different
languages.</p>

<p><i>Theology.</i>&mdash;There is an article on Theological Libraries in
the United States, in the U.S. Report on Public Libraries
(pp. 127-160). The following extract contains some
particulars respecting these.&mdash;"There are reported
twenty-four libraries, which contain from 10,000 to 34,000
volumes; and these twenty-four libraries belong to ten
different denominations. Three Baptist, two Catholic, two
Congregational, three Episcopal, one Lutheran, two
Methodist, seven Presbyterian, one Reformed (Dutch), one
Reformed (German), and two Unitarian. And, if we include
those libraries which contain less than 10,000 volumes, the
list of different denominations to which they belong is
extended to fifteen or sixteen."</p>

<p>A considerable number of Bibliographies of Theology will be
found in the British Museum Hand-list. Darling's Cyclop&aelig;dia
Bibliographica (1854-59), Malcom's Theological Index
(Boston, 1868), and Zuchold's Bibliotheca Theologica
(G&ouml;ttingen, 1864), may be specially mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Topography.</i>&mdash;Gough's British Topography (2 vols. 4to.
1780) is an interesting and useful book, and Upcott's
Bibliographical Account of the principal works relating to
British Topography, 3 vols. 8vo. (1818), forms one of the
best specimens of English bibliography extant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Topography.</i>&mdash;Mr. J.P. Anderson's Book of British
Topography (1881) is an indispensable book. Mr. Robert
Harrison has prepared for the Index Society an Index of
Books on Topography, arranged in one alphabet of places,
which has not yet been published. Mr. W.H.K. Wright
contributed a paper on "Special Collections of Local Books
in Provincial Libraries" to the Transactions of the First
Annual Meeting of the Library Association, 1878 (pp. 44-50).
Another paper on the same subject, by Mr. J.H. Nodal,
appears in the Transactions of the Second Annual Meeting of
the Library Association, 1879 (pp. 54-60), entitled "Special
Collections of Books in Lancashire and Cheshire," and in the
Appendix (pp. 139-148) is a full account of these
collections in Public Libraries and private hands.</p></div>

very useful list of trials in an alphabet of the persons
tried. The table is arranged under name, charge, date of

<p>A large amount of important information is to be found in the publications
of the numerous Societies formed for the purpose of supplying to their
subscribers valuable works which are but little likely to find publishers.
These publications have in a large number of instances added to our
knowledge of history and literature considerably. The Societies have much
increased of late years, but no record of the publications is easily to be
obtained, since the full account given in Bohn's Supplement to Lowndes's
<i>Bibliographer's Manual</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The earliest of Publishing Societies was the <i>Dilettanti
Society</i>, instituted in London in 1734,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> which issued some
fine illustrated volumes of classical travel. A long period
of time elapsed without any societies of a similar character
being formed.</p>

<p><i>The Roxburghe Club</i> formed in the year 1812 in
commemoration of the sale of the magnificent library of John
third Duke of Roxburghe (died March 19, 1804). It was
chiefly intended as a Social Club, and a long list of
bibliographical toasts was run through at the banquets. The
publications were not at first of any great literary value,
although some of them were curious and interesting. After a
time competent editors were employed, and some important
works produced. Sir Frederick Madden's editions of "Havelok
the Dane" was issued in 1828, of the Romance of "William and
the Werwolf" in 1832, and of the old English version of
"Gesta Romanorum" in 1838. The valuable "Manners and
Household Expenses of England in the Thirteenth and
Fifteenth Centuries," edited by T. Hudson Turner, was
presented to the Club by Beriah Botfield in 1841; Payne
Collier's edition of the "Household Books of John Duke of
Norfolk, and Thomas Earl of Surrey, 1481-1490," was issued
in 1844, and his "Five Old Plays illustrative of the Early
Progress of the English Drama" in 1851;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> the Rev. Joseph
Stevenson's edition of "The Owl and the Nightingale, a Poem
of the Twelfth Century," was issued in 1838, and his edition
of "The Ayenbite of Inwyt" in 1855; John Gough Nichols's
edition of the "Literary Remains of King Edward the Sixth"
appeared in 1857 and 1858 (2 vols.), and Dr. Furnivall's
edition of Henry Lonelich's "Seynt Graal" in 1863-1864.</p>

<p>Several years elapsed before the second great Printing Club
was founded. In 1823 <i>The Bannatyne Club</i> was started in
Edinburgh, chiefly by Sir Walter Scott, for the purpose of
printing works illustrative of the History, Antiquities and
Literature of Scotland. It derives its names from George
Bannatyne (born Feb. 22, 1545, died 1607). A long series of
books have been issued by the Club to its members, many of
which are of great interest. The Catalogue of the Abbotsford
Library was presented in 1839 to the members "by Major Sir
Walter Scott, Bart., as a slight return for their liberality
and kindness in agreeing to continue to that Library the
various valuable works printed under their superintendence."
In the same year appeared Sir Frederick Madden's edition of
<i>Sir Gawayne</i>. Bishop Gawin Douglas's "Palace of Honour" was
printed in 1827, and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> translation of Virgil's "&AElig;neid" in
1839 (2 vols.). The Club was closed in 1867.</p>

<p><i>The Maitland Club</i>, which derived its name from Sir Richard
Maitland of Lethington (born in 1496, died March 20, 1586),
was instituted in Glasgow in 1828. A volume containing "The
Burgh Records of the City of Glasgow, 1573 to 1581," was
presented to the Club in 1832-34; the Poems of Drummond of
Hawthornden in 1832; Robert Wodrow's "Collection upon the
Lives of the Reformers and most eminent Ministers of the
Church of Scotland" in 1834-45 (2 vols.). Dauncey's Ancient
Scottish Melodies in 1838. Sir Bevis of Hamtoun in the same
year, the Metrical Romance of Lancelot du Lak in 1839;
Wodrow's Analecta, or Materials for a History of Remarkable
Providences, in 1842-3 (4 vols.). Henry Laing's Descriptive
Catalogue of Ancient Seals, in 1850. The Club was closed in
1859.</p>

<p><i>The Abbotsford Club</i> was founded in honour of Sir Walter
Scott in 1834, by Mr. W.B.D.D. Turnbull. The first book
(issued in 1835) was a volume of "Ancient Mysteries from the
Digby MS."; "Arthur and Merlin, a Metrical Romance," was
printed in 1838; "Romances of Sir Guy of Warwick and Rembrun
his Son," in 1840; "The Legend of St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> Katherine of
Alexandra," in 1841; "Sir Degaree, a Metrical Romance of the
end of the nineteenth century," in 1849. The Club was closed
in 1866.</p>

<p>These Printing Clubs were select in their constitution, and
the books being printed for the members in small numbers,
they are difficult to obtain and their price is high.</p>

<p>With the foundation of the Camden Society an entirely new
system was adopted, and the general body of book lovers,
poor as well as rich, were appealed to with great success,
and valuable books were supplied to the subscribers at a
price which would have been impossible without such means.
The Camden Society is entitled to this honour on account of
the general interest of its publications, but the Surtees
Society was actually the first to inaugurate the new system.
The subscription fixed was double that which the founders of
the Camden Society adopted, but it was, perhaps, a bolder
step to start a Society, appealing to a somewhat restricted
public with a two guinea subscription, than to appeal to the
whole reading public with a subscription of one pound.
Before saying more of the Surtees and Camden Societies, it
will be necessary to mention some other printing clubs which
preceded them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Oriental Translation Fund</i> was established in 1828,
with the object of publishing Translations from Eastern MSS.
into the languages of Europe. When the issue of books was
discontinued, the stock of such books as remained was sold
off, and many of these can still be obtained at a cheap
rate.</p>

<p><i>The Iona Club</i> was instituted in 1833, for the purpose of
investigating the History, Antiquities, and early Literature
of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, but little has
been done in the way of publication. The first book was
"Collectanea de Rebus Albanicis," and the second,
"Transactions of the Club," vol. i. in 4 parts. A second
volume was announced, but never appeared.</p>

<p><i>The Surtees Society</i> was founded at Durham in 1834 for the
publication of inedited Manuscripts, illustrative of the
moral, the intellectual, the religious, and the social
condition of those parts of England and Scotland included on
the East, between the Humber and the Frith of Forth, and on
the west, between the Mersey and the Clyde, a region which
constituted the ancient kingdom of Northumberland. The
Society is named after Robert Surtees, of Mainforth, author
of the "History of the County Palatine of Durham." Although
founded more than fifty years ago, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> Society is still
flourishing, and carried on with the same vigour as of old.
The series of publications is a long one, and contains a
large number of most important works. The second book issued
was "Wills and Inventories, illustrative of the History,
Manners, Language, Statistics, etc., of the Northern
Counties of England, from the Eleventh Century downwards"
(Part 2 was issued in 1860); the third, "The Towneley
Mysteries or Miracle Plays"; the fourth, "Testamenta
Eboracensia: Wills illustrative of the History, Manners,
Language, Statistics, etc., of the Province of York, from
1300" (vol. 1). The second volume of this series was issued
in 1855. "Anglo-Saxon and Early English Psalter" was issued
in 1843-44 (2 vols.); "The Durham Household Book; or, the
Accounts of the Bursar of the Monastery of Durham, from 1530
to 1534," in 1844.</p>

<p><i>The Camden Society</i>, instituted in 1838, has issued to its
subscribers a large number of books of the greatest interest
on historical and literary subjects. The set of publications
is so well known that it is not necessary to enumerate
titles here. Among the most valuable are the several volumes
devoted to the correspondence of certain old families, such
as the "Plumpton Correspondence" (1839), "Egerton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> Papers"
(1840), "Rutland Papers" (1842), and "Savile Correspondence"
(1858). The Romances and Chronicles must also be mentioned,
and the remarkable edition of the oldest English Dictionary,
"Promptorium Parvulorum," which was fully and learnedly
edited by the late Mr. Albert Way. A second series was
commenced in 1871, which is still continued.</p>

<p>The same year which saw the foundation of the Camden Society
also gave birth to <i>The English Historical Society</i>. Sixteen
works of considerable value were issued, but the greatest of
these is the grand "Codex Diplomaticus &AElig;vi Saxonici" of the
late J. Mitchell Kemble (1845-48).</p>

<p><i>The Spalding Club</i>, named after John Spalding, Commissary
Clerk of Aberdeen, and founded at Aberdeen in 1839 for the
printing of the Historical, Ecclesiastical, Genealogical,
Topographical, and Literary Remains of the North-Eastern
Counties of Scotland, was formed on the model of the
exclusive clubs; but being affected by the more democratic
constitution of the later printing societies, its
subscription was fixed at one guinea. Amongst the most
interesting of the Club's publications are the "Sculptured
Stones of Scotland" (1856), "Barbour's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> Brus" (1856), and
the "Fasti Aberdonensis: Selections from the Records of the
University and King's College of Aberdeen from 1494 to 1854"
(1854).</p>

<p>The year 1840 saw the foundation of three very important
Societies, viz. the Parker, the Percy, and the Shakespeare.</p>

<p><i>The Parker Society</i> took its name from the famous
Archbishop of Canterbury, Martin Parker, and its objects
were (1) the reprinting, without abridgment, alteration or
omission, of the best works of the Fathers and early Writers
of the Reformed English Church published in the period
between the accession of Edward VI. and Queen Elizabeth; (2)
the printing of such works of other writers of the Sixteenth
Century as may appear desirable (including under both
classes some of the early English Translations of the
Foreign Reformers), and (3) the printing of some MSS. of the
same authors hitherto unpublished. The Society was an
enormous success, and at one time the list contained seven
thousand members; but owing to the multitude of copies
printed, and the somewhat dry character of the books
themselves, many of them can now be obtained at a
ridiculously small sum, the price of a complete set usually
averaging little more than a shilling a volume. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> the
series was completed, a valuable General Index to the whole
was compiled by Mr. Henry Gough, 1855.</p>

<p><i>The Percy Society</i> took its name from Bishop Percy, author
of the "Reliques of Ancient English Poetry" (born 1729, died
1811), and was founded for the purpose of bringing to light
important but obscure specimens of Ballad Poetry, or Works
illustrative of that department of Literature. The Society
was dissolved in 1853, but during the thirteen years of its
existence it produced a singularly interesting series of
publications. The number of separate works registered in
Bohn's Appendix to Lowndes's Bibliographer's Manual is 94,
besides "Quippes for Upstart Newfangled Gentlewomen by
Stephen Gosson," which was suppressed, and "Rhyming Satire
on the Pride and Vices of Women Now-a-days, by Charles
Bansley," 1540, which was reprinted in 1841, but not issued.
The set is much sought after, and fetches a good price.</p>

<p><i>The Shakespeare Society</i> was founded in 1840, to print
books illustrative of Shakespeare and of the literature of
his time, and a very valuable collection of works was issued
to the subscribers during the term of its existence. It was
dissolved in 1853, and the remaining stock was made up into
volumes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> sold off. There was much for the Society still
to do; but the controversy arising out of the discovery of
the forgeries connected with John Payne Collier's name made
it difficult for the Shakespearians to work together with
harmony.</p>

<p>In this same year the <i>Musical Antiquarian Society</i> was
founded, and during the seven years of its existence it
issued books of Madrigals, Operas, Songs, Anthems, etc., by
early English composers.</p>

<p>In the following year (1841), the <i>Motett Society</i> was
founded for the publication of Ancient Church Music. Five
parts only, edited by Dr. Rimbault, were issued.</p>

<p>In 1841 the <i>Society for the Publication of Oriental Texts</i>
was founded, and a series of works in Syriac, Arabic,
Sanscrit, and Persian was distributed to the subscribers
until 1851, when the Society was dissolved.</p>

<p><i>The Wodrow Society</i> was instituted in Edinburgh in 1841,
for the publication of the early writers of the Reformed
Church of Scotland, and named after the Rev. Robert Wodrow.
Among its publications are, "Autobiography and Diary of
James Melvill," "Correspondence of the Rev. R. Wodrow" (3
vols.), "History of the Reformation in Scotland, by John
Knox" (2 vols.). The Society was dissolved in 1848.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The &AElig;lfric Society</i> was founded in 1842 for the publication
of those Anglo-Saxon and other literary monuments, both
civil and ecclesiastical, tending to illustrate the early
state of England. The publications, which were not numerous,
were edited by Benjamin Thorpe and J.M. Kemble, and the
Society was discontinued in 1856.</p>

<p><i>The Chetham Society</i>, founded at Manchester in 1843, for
the publication of Historical and Literary remains connected
with the Palatine Counties of Lancaster and Chester, was
named after Humphrey Chetham (born 1580, died 1653). The
Society, which still flourishes, has now produced a very
long series of important works, and the volumes, which are
not often met with, keep up their price well.</p>

<p><i>The Sydenham Society</i> for reprinting Standard English Works
in Medical Literature, and for the Translation of Foreign
Authors, with notes, was founded in 1843. After printing a
number of important works, the Society was dissolved in
1858, and was succeeded by <i>The New Sydenham Society</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Spottiswoode Society</i> was founded at Edinburgh in 1843,
for the revival and publication of the acknowledged works of
the Bishops, Clergy, and Laity of the Episcopal Church of
Scotland, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> rare, authentic, and curious MSS., Pamphlets
and other Works illustrative of the Civil and Ecclesiastical
State of Scotland. It takes its name from John Spottiswoode,
the first duly consecrated Scottish Archbishop after the
Reformation (born 1566, died 1639.) The late Mr. Hill Burton
gives an amusing account of the foundation of this Society
in his delightful <i>Book-Hunter</i>. He writes: "When it was
proposed to establish an institution for reprinting the
works of the fathers of the Episcopal Church in Scotland, it
was naturally deemed that no more worthy or characteristic
name could be attached to it than that of the venerable
prelate, who by his learning and virtues had so long adorned
the Episcopal Chair of Moray and Ross [Robert Jolly], and
who had shown a special interest in the department of
literature to which the institution was to be devoted. Hence
it came to pass that, through a perfectly natural process,
the Association for the purpose of reprinting the works of
certain old divines was to be ushered into the world by the
style and title of the <span class="smcap">Jolly Club</span>. There happened to be
amongst those concerned, however, certain persons so
corrupted with the wisdom of this world, as to apprehend
that the miscellaneous public might fail to trace this
designation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> to its true origin, and might indeed totally
mistake the nature and object of the institution,
attributing to it aims neither consistent with the ascetic
life of the departed prelate, nor with the pious and
intellectual object of its founders. The counsels of these
worldly-minded persons prevailed. The Jolly Club was never
instituted,&mdash;at least as an association for the reprinting
of old books of divinity,&mdash;though I am not prepared to say
that institutions, more than one so designed may not exist
for other purposes. The object, however, was not entirely
abandoned. A body of gentlemen united themselves together
under the name of another Scottish prelate, whose fate had
been more distinguished, if not more fortunate, and the
Spottiswoode Society was established. Here, it will be
observed, there was a passing to the opposite extreme, and
so intense seems to have been the anxiety to escape from all
excuse for indecorous jokes or taint of joviality, that the
word Club, wisely adopted by other bodies of the same kind,
was abandoned, and this one called itself a Society." The
publications were discontinued about 1851.</p>

<p><i>The Calvin Translation Society</i> was established at
Edinburgh in 1843, and its work was completed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> 1855, by
the publication of twenty-two Commentaries, etc., of the
great reformer in fifty-two volumes.</p>

<p><i>The Ray Society</i> was founded in 1844 for the publication of
works on Natural History (Zoology and Botany), and a large
number of valuable books, fully illustrated, have been
produced, many of them translations from foreign works. Many
of the later publications are more elaborately coloured than
the earlier ones.</p>

<p><i>The Wernerian Club</i> was instituted in 1844 for the
republication of standard works of Scientific Authors of old
date.</p>

<p><i>The Handel Society</i> was founded at London in 1844, for the
purpose of printing the Works of Handel in full score.
Sixteen volumes were issued, and in 1858 the Society was
dissolved, the German Handel Society resuming the
publication.</p>

<p><i>The Hanserd Knollys Society</i> was instituted in 1845 for the
publication of the works of early English and other Baptist
writers, and one of these was an edition of Bunyan's Pilgrim
Progress from the text of the first edition. The Society was
dissolved about 1851.</p>

<p><i>The Caxton Society</i> was instituted in 1845 for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> the
publication of Chronicles and other writings hitherto
unpublished, illustrative of the history and miscellaneous
literature of the middle ages. This Society was formed on a
somewhat original basis. The members were to pay no annual
subscription, but they engaged to purchase one copy of all
books published by the Society. The expense of printing and
publishing to be defrayed out of the proceeds of the sale,
and the money remaining over to be paid to the editors.</p>

<p><i>The Cavendish Society</i> was instituted in 1846 for the
promotion of Chemical Science by the translation and
publication of valuable works and papers on Chemistry not
likely to be undertaken by ordinary publishers. During its
last years the Society existed for the publication of
Gmelin's voluminous "Handbook of Chemistry," and when this
work was completed, with a general Index, the Society ceased
to exist.</p>

<p><i>The Ecclesiastical History Society</i> was instituted in 1846,
and one of its early publications was the first volume of
Wood's "Athen&aelig; Oxoniensis," edited by Dr. Bliss, but this
only contained the life of Anthony Wood himself. The Society
was dissolved in 1854, after publishing the Book of Common
Prayer according<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> to a MS. in the Rolls Office, Dublin (3
vols.), and sundry other works.</p>

<p><i>The Hakluyt Society</i>, named after Richard Hakluyt (born
1553, died 1616), was founded at the end of 1846 for the
purpose of printing the most rare and valuable Voyages,
Travels and Geographical Records, from an early period of
exploratory enterprise to the circumnavigation of Dampier.
The first two volumes ("Sir Richard Hawkins's Voyage into
the South Sea, 1593," and "Select Letters of Columbus") were
issued in 1847, and the Society still flourishes. Between
1847 and 1885 the Society has presented to its members an
important series of books of travel, at the rate of about
two volumes a year for an annual subscription of one guinea.</p>

<p><i>The Pal&aelig;ontographical Society</i> was founded in 1847 for the
purpose of figuring and describing a stratigraphical series
of British Fossils. The annual volumes consist of portions
of works by the most eminent pal&aelig;ontologists, and these
works are completed as soon as circumstances allow, but
several of them are still incomplete.</p>

<p><i>The Arundel Society</i> is so important an institution that it
cannot be passed over in silence, although, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> the
publications chiefly consist of engravings,
chromolithographs, etc., it scarcely comes within the scope
of this chapter. The Society takes its name from Thomas
Howard Earl of Arundel, in the reigns of James I. and
Charles I., who has been styled the "Father of <i>vertu</i> in
England." It was founded in 1849, and its purpose is to
diffuse more widely, by means of suitable publications, a
knowledge both of the history and true principles of
Painting, Sculpture, and the higher forms of ornamental
design, to call attention to such masterpieces of the arts
as are unduly neglected, and to secure some transcript or
memorial of those which are perishing from ill-treatment or
decay. The publications of the Society have been very
successful, and many of them cannot now be obtained.</p>

<p>Most of the societies above described have appealed to a
large public, and endeavoured to obtain a large amount of
public support; but in 1853 was formed an exclusive society,
with somewhat the same objects as the Roxburghe Club. <i>The
Philobiblon Society</i> was instituted chiefly through the
endeavours of Mr. R. Monckton Milnes (the late Lord
Houghton) and the late Mons. Sylvain Van de Weyer. The
number of members was at first fixed at thirty-five, but was
raised in 1857 to forty, including the patron and honorary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
secretaries. The publications consist chiefly of a series of
Bibliographical and Historical Miscellanies, contributed by
the members, which fill several volumes. Besides these there
are "The Expedition to the Isle of Rhe by Lord Herbert of
Cherbury," edited and presented to the members by the Earl
of Powis; "Inventaire de tous les meubles du Cardinal
Mazarin," edited and presented by H.R.H. the Duke d'Aumale;
"Memoires de la Cour d'Espagne sous la regne de Charles II.,
1678-82," edited and presented by William Stirling
(afterwards Sir William Stirling Maxwell); "The Biography
and Bibliography of Shakespeare," compiled and presented by
Henry G. Bohn; "Analyse des Travaux de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des
Philobiblon de Londres," par Octave Delepierre.</p>

<p><i>The Ossianic Society</i> was instituted at Dublin in 1853 for
the preservation and publication of manuscripts in the Irish
Language, illustrative of the Fenian period of Irish
history, etc., with literal translations and notes.</p>

<p><i>The Warton Club</i> was instituted in 1854 and issued four
volumes, after which it was dissolved.</p>

<p><i>The Manx Society</i> was instituted at Douglas, Isle of Man,
in 1858, for the publication of National Documents of the
Isle of Man.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>All the Societies mentioned above are registered in Henry Bohn's Appendix
to Lowndes's Bibliographer's Manual, and lists of the publications up to
1864 are there given. Most of them are also described in Hume's "Learned
Societies and Printing Clubs of the United Kingdom" (1853). Since,
however, the publication of these two books, a considerable number of
important Printing Societies have been formed, and of these a list is not
readily obtainable, except by direct application to the respective
Secretaries.</p>

<p>The newly printed General Catalogue of the British Museum in the Reading
Room however contains a full list of the publications of the various
Societies under the heading of <i>Academies</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The foundation of the <i>Early English Text Society</i> in 1864
caused a renewed interest to be taken in the publications of
the Printing Clubs. The origin of the Society was in this
wise. When the Philological Society undertook the formation
of a great English Dictionary, the want of printed copies of
some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> chief monuments of the language was keenly
felt. Mr. F.J. Furnivall, with his usual energy, determined
to supply the want, and induced the Council of the
Philological Society to produce some valuable texts. It was
found, however, that these publications exhausted much of
the funds of the Society, which was required for the
printing of the papers read at the ordinary meetings, so
that it became necessary to discontinue them. Mr. Furnivall,
then, in conjunction with certain members of the
Philological Society, founded the Early English Text
Society. The Society possessed the inestimable advantage of
having among its founders Mr. Richard Morris (afterwards the
Rev. Dr. Morris), who entered with fervour into the scheme,
and produced a large amount of magnificent work for the
Society. Dr. Furnivall put the objects of the Society
forward very tersely when he said that none of us should
rest "till Englishmen shall be able to say of their early
literature what the Germans can now say with pride of
theirs&mdash;'every word of it is printed, and every word of it
is glossed.'"</p>

<p>The Society prospered, and in 1867 an Extra Series was
started, in which were included books that had already been
printed, but were difficult to obtain from their rarity and
price.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>One hundred and twenty-six volumes have been issued between
1864 and 1884, eighty-two volumes of the Original Series and
forty-four of the Extra Series, and there can be no doubt
that the publications of the Society have had an immense
influence in fostering the study of the English language.
The prefaces and glossaries given with each work contain an
amount of valuable information not elsewhere to be obtained.</p>

<p>These books throw light upon the growth of the language, and
place within the reach of a large number of readers works of
great interest in the literature of the country. The
greatest work undertaken by the Society is the remarkable
edition of "William's Vision of Piers the Plowman," which
Prof. Skeat has produced with an expenditure of great labour
during nearly twenty years. The last part, containing
elaborate notes and glossary, was issued in 1884.</p>

<p>The subjects treated of are very various. There is a fair
sprinkling of Romances, which will always be amongst the
most interesting of a Society's publications. Manners and
Customs are largely illustrated in a fair proportion of the
Texts, as also are questions of Social and Political
History. Perhaps the least interesting to the general reader
are the Theological Texts, which are numerous, but the
writers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> of these were thoroughly imbued with the spirit of
their times, and although they are apt to be prosy, they are
pretty sure to introduce some quaint bits which compensate
for a considerable amount of dulness. These books help us to
form a correct idea of the beliefs of our forefathers, and
to disabuse our minds of many mistaken views which we have
learnt from more popular but less accurate sources.</p>

<p><i>The Ballad Society</i> grew out of the publication, by special
subscription, of Bishop Percy's Folio Manuscript, edited by
F.J. Furnivall and J.W. Hales. This was issued in
connection with the Early English Text Society (but not as
one of its Texts), through the energy of Mr. Furnivall, who
had many difficulties to overcome before he was able to get
permission to print the manuscript, which had been very
faithfully guarded from the eyes of critics. He had to pay
for the privilege, and in the end the old volume was sold to
the nation, and it now reposes among the treasures of the
British Museum. When this useful work was completed, Mr.
Furnivall was anxious to follow it by a reprint of all the
known collections of Ballads, such as the Roxburghe,
Bagford, Rawlinson, Douce, etc., and for this purpose he
started the Ballad Society in 1868. He himself edited some
particularly interesting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> "Ballads from Manuscripts," and an
elaborate account of Captain Cox's Ballads and Books in a
new edition of Robert Laneham's Letter on the Entertainment
at Kenilworth in 1575. The veteran Ballad illustrator, Mr.
William Chappell, undertook to edit the "Roxburghe Ballads,"
and produced nine parts, when the Rev. J.W. Ebsworth took
the work off his hands. Mr. Ebsworth had previously
reproduced the "Bagford Ballads," and he is now the
editor-in-chief of the Society. The following is a short
list of the publications of the Society: Nos. 1, 2, 3, 10,
"Ballads from Manuscripts"; Nos. 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 18,
19. "The Roxburghe Ballads," edited by Wm. Chappell; No. 7,
"Captain Cox, his Ballads and Books"; No. 11, "Love Poems
and Humourous Ones"; Nos. 14, 15, 16, 17, "The Bagford
Ballads." No. 20, "The Amanda Group of Bagford Ballads;"
Nos. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, "The Roxburghe Ballads," edited
by the Rev. J.W. Ebsworth. No. 26 completes the fifth
volume of the "Roxburghe Ballads." There are two more
volumes to come, and then Mr. Ebsworth will undertake "The
Civil War and Protectorate Ballads." Much of the work on
these volumes is done, and they only await an increase in
the subscription list. It is to be hoped that when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> good
work done by the Ballad Society is better known, the editor
will not be kept back in his useful course by the want of
funds for printing. Mr. Ebsworth's thorough work is too well
known to need praise here, but it may be noted that his
volumes contain a remarkable amount of illustration of the
manners of the time not to be obtained elsewhere. The value
of this is the more apparent by the system of arrangement in
marked periods which the editor has adopted.</p>

<p><i>The Chaucer Society</i> was founded in 1868 by Mr. Furnivall,
"to do honour to Chaucer, and to let the lovers and students
of him see how far the best unprinted Manuscripts of his
Works differed from the printed texts." For the Canterbury
Tales, Mr. Furnivall has printed the six best unprinted MSS.
in two forms&mdash;(1) in large oblong parts, giving the parallel
texts; (2) in octavo, each text separately. The six
manuscripts chosen are&mdash;The Ellesmere; The Lansdowne (Brit.
Mus.); The Hengwrt; The Corpus, Oxford; The Cambridge
(University Library); The Petworth. Dr. Furnivall has now
added Harleian 7334 to complete the series. The Society's
publications are issued in two series, of which the first
contains the different Texts of Chaucer's Works,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> and the
second such originals of and essays on these as can be
procured, with other illustrative treatises and
Supplementary Tales.</p>

<p><i>The Spenser Society</i> was founded at Manchester in 1867 for
the publication of well-printed editions of old English
authors in limited numbers. The chief publication issued to
subscribers was a reprint, in three volumes folio, of the
works of John Taylor, the Water-poet, from the original
folio. The other publications are in small quarto, and among
them are the works of John Taylor not included in the folio,
the works of Wither, etc.</p>

<p><i>The Roxburghe Library</i> was a subscription series, commenced
by Mr. W. Carew Hazlitt in 1868, with the same objects as a
publishing society. It was discontinued in 1870. The
following is a list of the publications:&mdash;"Romance of Paris
and Vienne"; "William Browne's Complete Works," 2 vols.;
"Inedited Tracts of the 16th and 17th Centuries
(1579-1618)"; "The English Drama and Stage under the Tudor
and Stuart Princes, 1543-1664"; "George Gascoigne's Complete
Poems," 2 vols.; "Thomas Carew's Poems."</p>

<p><i>The Harleian Society</i> was founded in 1869. Their chief
publication has been the late Colonel Chester's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
magnificently edited Registers of Westminster Abbey. Other
Registers published are those of St. Peter's, Cornhill; St.
Dionis Backchurch; St. Mary Aldermary; St. Thomas the
Apostle; St. Michael, Cornhill; St. Antholin, Budge Lane;
and St. John the Baptist, on Wallbrook. Of the other
publications there are Visitations of Bedfordshire,
Cheshire, Cornwall, Cumberland, Devon, Essex,
Leicestershire, London 1568, 1633, Nottingham, Oxford,
Rutland, Somersetshire, Warwickshire, and Yorkshire, and Le
Neve's Catalogue of Knights.</p>

<p><i>The Hunterian Club</i> was founded at Glasgow in 1871, and
named after the Hunterian Library in the University. Among
the publications of the Club are a Series of Tracts by
Thomas Lodge and Samuel Rowlands; the Poetical Works of
Alexander Craig; Poetical Works of Patrick Hannay; Sir T.
Overburie's Vision by Richard Niccols, 1616. The printing of
the famous Bannatyne Manuscript, compiled by George
Bannatyne, 1568, was commenced by the Society in 1873, and
the seventh part, which completed this invaluable collection
of Scottish Poetry, was issued in 1881.</p>

<p><i>The Folk Lore Society</i> was founded by the late Mr. W.J.
Thoms (inventor of the term Folk Lore) in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> 1878, and during
the seven years of its existence it has done much valuable
work, chiefly through the energetic direction of Mr. G.L.
Gomme, the Hon. Sec. (now Director). The object of the
Society is stated to be "the preservation and publication of
Popular Traditions, Legendary Ballads, Local Proverbial
Sayings, Superstitions and Old Customs (British and
Foreign), and all subjects relating to them." The principal
publication of the Society, the <i>Folk Lore Record</i>, now the
<i>Folk Lore Journal</i>, was at first issued in volumes, and
afterwards in monthly numbers. It is now a quarterly. The
other publications are:&mdash;Henderson's Folk-Lore of the
Northern Counties of England and the Borders, a new edition;
Aubrey's Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme; Gregor's Notes
on the Folk-Lore of the North-east of Scotland; Comparetti's
Book of Sindibad and Pedroso's Portuguese Folk Tales;
Black's Folk Medicine; Callaway's Religious System of the
Amazulu.</p>

<p>The year 1873 saw the formation of several publishing
Societies.</p>

<p><i>The New Shakspere Society</i> was founded by Dr. F.J.
Furnivall, for the reading of papers, which have been
published in a Series of Transactions, and also for the
publication of collations of the Quarto Plays, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> works
illustrating the great Dramatist's times. Among the latter
works are Harrison's Description of England, Stubbes's
Anatomie of Abuses, Dr. Ingleby's Shakespeare's Centurie of
Prayse, etc.</p>

<p><i>The English Dialect Society</i> was founded at Cambridge by
the Rev. Professor Skeat. Its objects are stated to be (1)
to bring together all those who have made a study of any of
the Provincial Dialects of England, or who are interested in
the subject of Provincial English; (2) to combine the
labours of collectors of Provincial English words by
providing a common centre to which they may be sent, so as
to gather material for a general record of all such words;
(3) to publish (subject to proper revision) such collections
of Provincial English words that exist at present only in
manuscript; as well as to reprint such Glossaries of
provincial words as are not generally accessible, or are
inserted in books of which the main part relates to other
subjects; and (4) to supply references to sources of
information which may be of material assistance to
word-collectors, students, and all who have a general or
particular interest in the subject. The publications are
arranged under the following Series: A, Bibliographical; B,
Reprinted Glossaries; C, Original Glossaries; D,
Miscellaneous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> In 1875 the Society was transferred to
Manchester, and Mr. J.H. Nodal became Honorary Secretary.</p>

<p><i>The Pal&aelig;ographical Society</i> was formed for the purpose of
reproducing Specimens of Manuscripts, and it has produced a
Series of Facsimiles of Ancient Manuscripts, edited by E.A.
Bond and E.M. Thompson, Part 1 being issued in 1873.</p>

<p>At the end of the year 1877 <i>The Index Society</i> was founded
for the purpose of producing (1) Indexes of Standard Works;
(2) Subject Indexes of Science, Literature and Art; and (3)
a General Reference Index. The publications were commenced
in 1878, and the First Annual Meeting was held in March,
1879, the Earl of Carnarvon being the first President. The
first publication was "What is an Index?" by H.B. Wheatley.
Among the important books issued by the Society may be
mentioned Solly's "Index of Hereditary Titles of Honour";
Daydon Jackson's "Guide to the Literature of Botany" and
"Literature of Vegetable Technology," and Rye's "Index of
Norfolk Topography."</p>

<p>The <i>Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies</i> was
founded in 1879 for the following objects: (1) To advance
the study of the Greek language, literature, and art, and to
illustrate the history of the Greek race<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> in the ancient,
Byzantine, and Neo-Hellenic periods, by the publication of
memoirs and inedited documents or monuments in a Journal to
be issued periodically. (2) To collect drawings, facsimiles,
transcripts, plans, and photographs of Greek inscriptions,
MSS., works of art, ancient sites and remains, and with this
view to invite travellers to communicate to the Society
notes or sketches of arch&aelig;ological and topographical
interest. (3) To organise means by which members of the
Society may have increased facilities for visiting ancient
sites and pursuing arch&aelig;ological researches in countries
which, at any time, have been the sites of Hellenic
civilization. Five volumes of the <i>Journal</i> have been
issued.</p>

<p><i>The Topographical Society of London</i> was formed in 1880.
The Inaugural Meeting was held at the Mansion House, and the
first Annual Meeting at Drapers' Hall on Feb. 3, 1882, with
the Lord Mayor (Sir John Whitaker Ellis), President, in the
chair. The following reproductions have been issued to
subscribers:&mdash;Van der Wyngaerde's View of London, ab. 1550,
7 sheets; Braun &amp; Hogenberg's Plan of London, 1 sheet;
Visscher's View of London, 4 sheets.</p>

<p><i>The Browning Society</i> was founded by Dr. Furnivall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> in
1881, and besides papers read at the meetings, the Society
has issued Dr. Furnivall's "Bibliography of Browning."</p>

<p><i>The Wyclif Society</i> was founded also by Dr. Furnivall in
1882, for the publication of the complete works of the great
Reformer.</p>

<p><i>The Pipe Roll Society</i> was established in 1883, and in 1885
the first three volumes of its publications have been issued
to the members. These are&mdash;Vol. 1, Pipe Rolls, 5 Hen. II.;
Vol. 2, 6 Hen. II.; Vol. 3, Introduction.</p>

<p><i>The Oxford Historical Society</i> was formed in 1884, and four
handsome volumes have been issued for that year and 1885.
These are&mdash;1, "Register of the University of Oxford" (vol.
1, 1449-63, 1505-71), edited by the Rev. C.W. Boase; 2,
"Remarks and Collections of Thomas Hearne" (vol. 1, July 4,
1705-March 19, 1707), edited by C.E. Doble, M.A. Both these
volumes are supplied with temporary Indexes. 3, "The Early
History of Oxford, 727-1100," by James Parker; 4, "Memories
of Merton College," by the Hon. George C. Brodrick; 5,
"Collectanea." First Series. Edited by C.R.L. Fletcher.</p>

<p><i>The Middlesex County Record Society</i> was formed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> 1885
"for the purpose of publishing the more interesting portions
of the old County Records of Middlesex, which have lately
been arranged and calendared by order of the Justices."
Nothing has been published as yet, but Mr. Cordy Jeaffreson
is engaged upon the first two volumes, one of which will be
issued shortly.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. A.B. Grosart has himself printed by
subscription more works of our Old Writers than many a
Society, and therefore it is necessary to mention his
labours here, although a complete list of them cannot be
given. The chief series are: "The Fuller Worthies Library,"
39 volumes; "The Chertsey Worthies Library," 14 vols. 4to.,
and "The Huth Library."</p></div>

</div>

<p>The idea of a Child's Library is to a great extent modern, and it is not
altogether clear that it is a good one, except in the case of those
children who have no books of their own. It is far better that each child
should have his own good books, which he can read over and over again,
thus thoroughly mastering their contents.</p>

<p>It is a rather wide-spread notion that there is some sort of virtue in
reading for reading's sake, although really a reading boy may be an idle
boy. When a book is read, it should be well thought over before another is
begun, for reading without thought generates no ideas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>One advantage of a Child's Library should be that the reader is
necessarily forced to be careful, so as to return the books uninjured.
This is a very important point, for children should be taught from their
earliest years to treat books well, and not to destroy them as they often
do. We might go farther than this and say that children should be taught
at school how to handle a book. It is really astonishing to see how few
persons (not necessarily children) among those who have not grown up among
books know how to handle them. It is positive torture to a man who loves
books to see the way they are ordinarily treated. Of course it is not
necessary to mention the crimes of wetting the fingers to turn over the
leaves, or turning down pages to mark the place; but those who ought to
know better will turn a book over on its face at the place where they have
left off reading, or will turn over pages so carelessly that they give a
crease to each which will never come out.</p>

<p>For a healthy education it is probably best that a child should have the
run of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> a library for adults (always provided that dangerous books are
carefully excluded). A boy is much more likely to enjoy and find benefit
from the books he selects himself than from those selected for him.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the child should be considered in the selection of
books; thus it is scarcely fair when children are working hard at school
all day that they should be made to read so-called instructive books in
the evening. They have earned the right to relaxation and should be
allowed good novels. To some boys books of Travels and History are more
acceptable than novels, but all children require some Fiction, and, save
in a few exceptional cases, their imaginations require to be cultivated.</p>

<p>It will soon be seen whether children have healthy or unhealthy tastes. If
healthy, they are best left to themselves; if unhealthy, they must be
directed.</p>

<p>It is easy for the seniors to neglect the children they have under them,
and it is easy to direct them overmuch, but it is difficult to watch and
yet let the children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> go their own way. We are apt, in arranging for
others, to be too instructive; nothing is less acceptable to children or
less likely to do them good than to be preached at. Moral reflections in
books are usually skipped by children, and unless somewhat out of the
common, probably by grown-up persons as well. Instruction should grow
naturally out of the theme itself, and form an integral part of it, so
that high aims and noble thoughts may naturally present themselves to the
readers.</p>

<p>One of the chapters in the United States Libraries' Report is on "School
and Asylum Libraries" (pp. 38-59), in which we are informed that New York
was the pioneer in founding school libraries. "In 1827 Governor De Witt
Clinton, in his message to the legislature, recommended their formation;
but it was not till 1835 that the friends of free schools saw their hopes
realized in the passage of a law which permitted the voters in any school
district to levy a tax of $20 to begin a library, and a tax of $10 each
succeeding year to provide for its increase."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>Another chapter in the same Report is on "Public Libraries and the Young"
(pp. 412-418), in which Mr. Wm. J. Fletcher advocates the use of the
library as an addition to the school course. He writes, "It only remains
now to say that, as we have before intimated, the public library should be
viewed as an adjunct of the public school system, and to suggest that in
one or two ways the school may work together with the library in directing
the reading of the young. There is the matter of themes for the writing of
compositions; by selecting subjects on which information can be had at the
library, the teacher can send the pupil to the library as a student, and
readily put him in communication with, and excite his interest in, classes
of books to which he has been a stranger and indifferent."</p>

<p>A very interesting book on this subject is entitled "Libraries and
Schools. Papers selected by Samuel S. Green. New York (F. Leypoldt),
1883." It contains the following subjects: "The Public Library and the
Public Schools;" "The Relation of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> Public Library to the Public
Schools"; "Libraries as Educational Institutions"; "The Public Library as
an Auxiliary to the Public Schools"; "The Relation of Libraries to the
School System"; and "A Plan of Systematic Training in Reading at School."</p>

<p>"<i>Books for the Young, a Guide for Parents and Children.</i> Compiled by C.
M. Hewins. New York (F. Leypoldt), 1882," is an extremely useful little
book. It contains a valuable list of books arranged in classes. Certain
marks are used to indicate the character of the books, thus the letter
(<i>c</i>) indicates that the book is especially suitable for children under
ten, (<i>b</i>) that it is especially suitable for boys, and (<i>g</i>) that it is
especially suitable for girls.</p>

<p>Prefixed are eight sensible rules as to how to teach the right use of
books.</p>

<p>Perkins's "Best Reading" contains a good list of books for children (pp.
299-303).</p>

<p>The children's books of the present day are so beautifully produced that
the elders are naturally induced to exclaim, "We never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> had such books as
these," but probably we enjoyed our books as well as our children do
theirs. What a thrill of pleasure the middle-aged man feels when a book
which amused his childhood comes in his way: this, however, is seldom, for
time has laid his decaying hand upon them&mdash;</p>

<p>The children for whom Miss Kate Greenaway and Mr. Caldecott draw and Mrs.
Gatty and Mrs. Ewing wrote are indeed fortunate, but we must not forget
that Charles and Mary Lamb wrote delightful books for the young, that Miss
Edgeworth's stories are ever fresh, and that one of the most charming
children's stories ever written is Mrs. Sherwood's <i>Little Woodman</i>.</p>

<p>A short list of a Child's Library is quoted in the <i>Library Journal</i> (vol.
viii. p. 57) from the <i>Woman's Journal</i>. The family for whom it was chosen
consisted of children from three to twelve, the two eldest being girls.
The books are mostly American, and but little known in this country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>Library Journal</i> remarks on the list, "Guest's Lectures
on English History is better than Dickens's, and the 'Prudy' children are
so mischievous, so full of young Americanisms, and so far from being
'wells of English undefiled,' that they are not always good companions for
boys and girls. I have known a child's English spoiled by reading the
Prudy books."</p>

<p>Some of the old-fashioned children's books have been reprinted, and these
will generally be found very acceptable to healthy-minded children, but
some of the old books are not easily met with. No Child's Library should
be without a good collection of Fairy Tales, a careful selection of the
Arabian Nights, or Robinson Crusoe. Gulliver's Travels is very unsuited for
children, although often treated as a child's book. Berquin's <i>Children's
Friend</i>, Edgeworth's <i>Parent's Assistant</i> and the Aikins's <i>Evenings at
Home</i>, will surely still amuse children, although some may think their
teaching too didactic. It is only by practical experience that we can tell
what children will like.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> <i>Sandford and Merton</i> is, I believe, usually
considered as hopelessly out of date, but I have found young hearers
follow my reading of it with the greatest interest. <i>The Pilgrim's
Progress</i> will always have as great a fascination for the young as it must
have for their elders; but there is much preaching in it which must be
skipped, or the attention of the hearers will flag.</p>

<p>In the Fourth Chapter of this Volume two lists of selected books are
given, viz. The Comtist's Library, and a list of one hundred good novels.
Since that chapter was written and printed, much public attention has been
drawn to this branch of our subject by the publication of Sir John
Lubbock's list of books which he recommended to the members of the Working
Men's College, when he lectured at that place on "Books." The comments by
eminent men, which have appeared in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, have also
attracted attention, and it seems desirable that some note on this list
should appear in these pages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>
Selections from&mdash;Thackeray, Dickens, George Eliot, Kingsley, Scott, Bulwer-Lytton.<br />
</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind by the reader that this list, although the one
sent round for criticism by the editor of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, is not
really Sir John Lubbock's. This will be found on p. 240. Sir John
Lubbock's address was not given in full, and the list drawn up by the
<i>Pall Mall</i>, from the reports in the daily papers, contained in fact only
about 85 books.</p>

<p>It seems necessary to allude particularly to this imperfect list, because
it is the only one upon which the critics were asked to give an opinion,
and their criticisms are peculiarly interesting, as they give us an
important insight into the tastes and opinions of our teachers. In itself
it is almost impossible to make a list that will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> be practically useful,
because tastes and needs differ so widely, that a course of reading
suitable for one man may be quite unsuitable for another. It is also very
doubtful whether a conscientious passage through a "cut-and-dried" list of
books will feed the mind as a more original selection by each reader
himself would do. It is probably best to start the student well on his way
and then leave him to pursue it according to his own tastes. Each book
will help him to another, and consultation with some of the many manuals
of English literature will guide him towards a good choice. This is in
effect what Mr. Bond, Principal Librarian of the British Museum, says in
his reply, to the circular of the editor of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>. He
writes "The result of several persons putting down the titles of books
they considered 'best reading' would be an interesting but very imperfect
bibliography of as many sections of literature;" and, again, "The beginner
should be advised to read histories of the literature of his own and
other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> countries&mdash;as Hallam's 'Introduction to the Literature of Europe,'
Joseph Warton's 'History of English Poetry,' Craik's 'History of English
Literature,' Paine's History, and others of the same class. These would
give him a survey of the field, and would quicken his taste for what was
naturally most congenial to him."</p>

<p>There probably is no better course of reading than that which will
naturally occur to one who makes an honest attempt to master our own noble
literature. This is sufficient for the lifetime of most men without
incursions into foreign literature. All cultivated persons will wish to
become acquainted with the masterpieces of other nations, but this
diversion will not be advisable if it takes the reader away from the study
of the masterpieces of his own literature.</p>

<p>Turning to the comments on the <i>Pall Mall Gazette's</i> list, we may note one
or two of the most important criticisms. The Prince of Wales very justly
suggested that Dryden should not be omitted from such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> a list. Mr.
Chamberlain asked whether the Bible was excluded by accident or design,
and Mr. Irving suggested that the Bible and Shakespeare form together a
very comprehensive library.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin's reply is particularly interesting, for he adds but little,
contenting himself with the work of destruction. He writes, "Putting my
pen lightly through the needless&mdash;and blottesquely through the rubbish and
poison of Sir John's list&mdash;I leave enough for a life's liberal
reading&mdash;and choice for any true worker's loyal reading. I have added one
quite vital and essential book&mdash;Livy (the two first books), and three
plays of Aristophanes (<i>Clouds</i>, <i>Birds</i>, and <i>Plutus</i>). Of travels, I
read myself all old ones I can get hold of; of modern, Humboldt is the
central model. Forbes (James Forbes in Alps) is essential to the modern
Swiss tourist&mdash;of sense." Mr. Ruskin puts the word <i>all</i> to Plato,
<i>everything</i> to Carlyle, and <i>every word</i> to Scott. Pindar's name he adds
in the list of the classics, and after Bacon's name he writes "chiefly the
<i>New Atlantis</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>The work of destruction is marked by the striking out of all the
<i>Non-Christian Moralists</i>, of all the Theology and Devotion, with the
exception of Jeremy Taylor and the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>. The
Nibelungenlied and Malory's <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> (which, by the way, is in
prose) go out, as do Sophocles and Euripides among the Greek Dramatists.
<i>The Knights</i> is struck out to make way for the three plays of
Aristophanes mentioned above. Gibbon, Voltaire, Hume, and Grote all go, as
do all the philosophers but Bacon. Cook's Voyages and Darwin's Naturalist
in the <i>Beagle</i> share a similar fate. Southey, Longfellow, Swift, Hume,
Macaulay, and Emerson, Goethe and Marivaux, all are so unfortunate as to
have Mr. Ruskin's pen driven through their names. Among the novelists
Dickens and Scott only are left. The names of Thackeray, George Eliot,
Kingsley, and Bulwer-Lytton are all erased.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin sent a second letter full of wisdom till he came to his reasons
for striking out Grote's "History of Greece," "Confessions of St.
Augustine," John Stuart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> Mill, Charles Kingsley, Darwin, Gibbon, and
Voltaire. With these reasons it is to be hoped that few readers will
agree.</p>

<p>Mr. Swinburne makes a new list of his own which is very characteristic.
No. 3 consists of "Selections from the Bible: comprising Job, the Psalms,
Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Joel; the Gospels of
St. Matthew and St. Luke, the Gospel and the First Epistle of St. John and
Epistle of St. James." No. 12 is Villon, and Nos. 45 to 49 consist of the
plays of Ford, Dekker, Tourneur, Marston, and Middleton; names very dear
to the lover of our old Drama, but I venture to think names somewhat
inappropriate in a list of books for a reader who does not make the drama
a speciality. Lamb's Selections would be sufficient for most readers.</p>

<p>Mr. William Morris supplies a full list with explanations, which are of
considerable interest as coming from that distinguished poet.</p>

<p>Archdeacon Farrar gives, perhaps, the best test for a favourite author,
that is, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> selection of his works in the event of all others being
destroyed. He writes, "But if all the books in the world were in a blaze,
the first twelve which I should snatch out of the flames would be the
Bible, <i>Imitatio Christi</i>, Homer, &AElig;schylus, Thucydides, Tacitus, Virgil,
Marcus Aurelius, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth. Of living authors
I would save first the works of Tennyson, Browning and Ruskin."</p>

<p>Another excellent test is that set up by travellers and soldiers. A book
must be good when one of either of these classes decides to place it among
his restricted baggage. Mr. H.M. Stanley writes, "You ask me what books I
carried with me to take across Africa. I carried a great many&mdash;three
loads, or about 180 lbs. weight; but as my men lessened in numbers,
stricken by famine, fighting and sickness, they were one by one
reluctantly thrown away, until finally, when less than 300 miles from the
Atlantic, I possessed only the Bible, Shakespeare, Carlyle's Sartor
Resartus, Norie's Navigation, and Nautical Almanac for 1877.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> Poor
Shakspeare was afterwards burned by demand of the foolish people of Zinga.
At Bonea, Carlyle and Norie and Nautical Almanac were pitched away, and I
had only the old Bible left." He then proceeds to give a list of books
which he allowed himself when "setting out with a tidy battalion of men."</p>

<p>Lord Wolseley writes, "During the mutiny and China war I carried a
Testament, two volumes of Shakespeare that contained his best plays, and
since then, when in the field, I have always carried: Book of Common
Prayer, Thomas &agrave; Kempis, Soldier's Pocket Book.... The book that I like
reading at odd moments is 'The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius.'" He then
adds, for any distant expedition, a few books of History (Creasy's
"Decisive Battles," Plutarch's "Lives," Voltaire's "Charles XII.,"
"C&aelig;sar," by Froude, and Hume's "England"). His Fiction is confined to
Macaulay's "History of England" and the "Essays."</p>

<p>Mr. Quaritch remarks that "Sir John's 'working man' is an ideal creature.
I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> known many working men, but none of them could have suggested such
a feast as he has prepared for them." He adds, "In my younger days I had
no books whatever beyond my school books. Arrived in London in 1842, I
joined a literary institution, and read all their historical works. To
read fiction I had no time. A friend of mine read novels all night long,
and was one morning found dead in his bed." If Mr. Quaritch intends this
as a warning, he should present the fact for the consideration of those
readers who swell the numbers of novels in the statistics of the Free
Libraries.</p>

<p>Looking at the <i>Pall Mall Gazette's</i> list, it naturally occurs to us that
it would be a great error for an Englishman to arrange his reading so that
he excluded Chaucer while he included Confucius. Among the names of modern
novelists it is strange that Jane Austen and Charlotte Bront&euml; should have
been omitted. In Sir John Lubbock's own list it will be seen that the
names of Chaucer and Miss Austen occur. Among Essayists one would like to
have seen at least the names<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> of Charles Lamb, De Quincey, and Landor, and
many will regret to find such delightful writers as Walton and Thomas
Fuller omitted. We ought, however, to be grateful to Sir John Lubbock for
raising a valuable discussion which is likely to draw the attention of
many readers to books which might otherwise have been most unjustly
neglected by them.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The following is Sir John Lubbock's list. It will be seen that several of
the books, whose absence is remarked on, do really form part of the list,
and that the objections of the critics are so far met.</p>
